The question tonight, as I understand it, is "The Negro Revolt, and Where Do We Go From Here?" or What Next?" In my little humble way of understanding it, it points toward either the ballot or the bullet.

Before we try and explain what is meant by the ballot or the bullet, I would like to clarify something concerning myself. I'm still a Muslim; my religion is still Islam. That's my personal belief. Just as Adam Clayton Powell is a Christian minister who heads the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, but at the same time takes part in the political struggles to try and bring about rights to the black people in this country; and Dr. Martin Luther King is a Christian minister down in Atlanta, Georgia, who heads another organization fighting for the civil rights of black people in this country; and Reverend Galamison, I guess you've heard of him, is another Christian minister in New York who has been deeply involved in the school boycotts to eliminate segregated education; well, I myself am a minister, not a Christian minister, but a Muslim minister; and I believe in action on all fronts by whatever means necessary.

Although I'm still a Muslim, I'm not here tonight to discuss my religion. I'm not here to try and change your religion. I'm not here to argue or discuss anything that we differ about, because it's time for us to submerge our differences and realize that it is best for us to first see that we have the same problem, a common problem, a problem that will make you catch hell whether you're a Baptist, or a Methodist, or a Muslim, or a nationalist. Whether you're educated or illiterate, whether you live on the boulevard or in the alley, you're going to catch hell just like I am. We're all in the same boat and we all are going to catch the same hell from the same man. He just happens to be a white man. All of us have suffered here, in this country, political oppression at the hands of the white man, economic exploitation at the hands of the white man, and social degradation at the hands of the white man.

Now in speaking like this, it doesn't mean that we're anti-white, but it does mean we're anti-exploitation, we're anti-degradation, we're anti-oppression. And if the white man doesn't want us to be anti-him, let him stop oppressing and exploiting and degrading us. Whether we are Christians or Muslims or nationalists or agnostics or atheists, we must first learn to forget our differences. If we have differences, let us differ in the closet; when we come out in front, let us not have anything to argue about until we get finished arguing with the man. If the late President Kennedy could get together with Khrushchev and exchange some wheat, we certainly have more in common with each other than Kennedy and Khrushchev had with each other.

If we don't do something real soon, I think you'll have to agree that we're going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet. It's one or the other in 1964. It isn't that time is running out -- time has run out!

1964 threatens to be the most explosive year America has ever witnessed. The most explosive year. Why? It's also a political year. It's the year when all of the white politicians will be back in the so-called Negro community jiving you and me for some votes. The year when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false promises, building up our hopes for a letdown, with their trickery and their treachery, with their false promises which they don't intend to keep. As they nourish these dissatisfactions, it can only lead to one thing, an explosion; and now we have the type of black man on the scene in America today -- I'm sorry, Brother Lomax -- who just doesn't intend to turn the other cheek any longer.
Don't let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you. If they draft you, they send you to Korea and make you face 800 million Chinese. If you can be brave over there, you can be brave right here. These odds aren't as great as those odds. And if you fight here, you will at least know what you're fighting for.

I'm not a politician, not even a student of politics; in fact, I'm not a student of much of anything. I'm not a Democrat. I'm not a Republican, and I don't even consider myself an American. If you and I were Americans, there'd be no problem. Those Honkies that just got off the boat, they're already Americans; Polacks are already Americans; the Italian refugees are already Americans. Everything that came out of Europe, every blue-eyed thing, is already an American. And as long as you and I have been over here, we aren't Americans yet.

Well, I am one who doesn't believe in deluding myself. I'm not going to sit at your table and watch you eat, with nothing on my plate, and call myself a diner. Sitting at the table doesn't make you a diner, unless you eat some of what's on that plate. Being here in America doesn't make you an American. Being born here in America doesn't make you an American. Why, if birth made you American, you wouldn't need any legislation; you wouldn't need any amendments to the Constitution; you wouldn't be faced with civil-rights filibustering in Washington, D.C., right now. They don't have to pass civil-rights legislation to make a Polack an American.

No, I'm not an American. I'm one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of Americanism. One of the 22 million black people who are the victims of democracy, nothing but disguised hypocrisy. So, I'm not standing here speaking to you as an American, or a patriot, or a flag-saluter, or a flag-waver -- no, not I. I'm speaking as a victim of this American system. And I see America through the eyes of the victim. I don't see any American dream; I see an American nightmare.

These 22 million victims are waking up. Their eyes are coming open. They're beginning to see what they used to only look at. They're becoming politically mature. They are realizing that there are new political trends from coast to coast. As they see these new political trends, it's possible for them to see that every time there's an election the races are so close that they have to have a recount. They had to recount in Massachusetts to see who was going to be governor, it was so close. It was the same way in Rhode Island, in Minnesota, and in many other parts of the country. And the same with Kennedy and Nixon when they ran for president. It was so close they had to count all over again. Well, what does this mean? It means that when white people are evenly divided, and black people have a bloc of votes of their own, it is left up to them to determine who's going to sit in the White House and who's going to be in the dog house.

Lt. was the black man's vote that put the present administration in Washington, D.C. Your vote, your dumb vote, your ignorant vote, your wasted vote put in an administration in Washington, D.C., that has seen fit to pass every kind of legislation imaginable, saving you until last, then filibustering on top of that. And your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress we're making. And what a good president we have. If he wasn't good in Texas, he sure can't be good in Washington, D.C. Because Texas is a lynch state. It is in the same breath as Mississippi, no different; only they lynch you in Texas with a Texas accent and lynch you in Mississippi with a Mississippi accent. And these Negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some coffee in the White House with a Texan, a Southern cracker -- that's all he is -- and then come out and tell you and me that he's going to be better for us because, since he's from the South, he knows how to deal with the Southerners. What kind of logic is that? Let Eastland be president, he's from the South too. He should be better able to deal with them than Johnson.

In this present administration they have in the House of Representatives 257 Democrats to only 177 Republicans. They control two-thirds of the House vote. Why can't they pass something that will help you and me? In the Senate, there are 67 senators who are of the Democratic Party. Only 33 of them are Republicans. Why, the Democrats have got the government sewed up, and you're the one who sewed it up for them. And what have they given you for it? Four years in office, and just now getting around to some civil-rights legislation. Just now, after everything else is gone, out of the way, they're going to sit down now and play with you all summer long -- the same old giant con game that they call filibuster. All those are in cahoots together. Don't you ever think they're not in cahoots together, for the man that is heading the civil-rights filibuster is a man from Georgia named Richard Russell. When Johnson became president, the first man he asked for when he got back to Washington, D.C., was "Dicky" -- that's how tight they are. That's his boy, that's his pal, that's his buddy. But they're playing that old con game. One of them makes believe he's for you, and he's got it fixed where the other one is so tight against you, he never has to keep his promise.

So it's time in 1964 to wake up. And when you see them coming up with that kind of conspiracy, let them know your eyes are open. And let them know you -- something else that's wide open too. It's got to be the ballot or the bullet. The ballot or the bullet. If you're afraid to use an expression like that, you should get on out of the country; you should get back in the cotton patch; you should get back in the alley. They get all the Negro vote, and after they get it, the Negro gets nothing in return. All they did when they got to Washington was give a few big Negroes big jobs. Those big Negroes didn't need big jobs, they already had jobs. That's camouflage, that's trickery, that's treachery, window-dressing. I'm not trying to knock out the Democrats for the Republicans. We'll get to them in a minute. But it is true; you put the Democrats first and the Democrats put you last.

Look at it the way it is. What alibis do they use, since they control Congress and the Senate? What alibi do they use when you and I ask, "Well, when are you going to keep your promise?" They blame the Dixiecrats. What is a Dixiecrat? A Democrat. A Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat in disguise. The titular head of the Democrats is also the head of the Dixiecrats, because the Dixiecrats are a part of the Democratic Party. The Democrats have never kicked the Dixiecrats out of the party. The Dixiecrats bolted themselves once, but the Democrats didn't put them out. Imagine, these lowdown Southern segregationists put the Northern Democrats down. But the Northern Democrats have never put the Dixiecrats down. No, look at that thing the way it is. They have got a con game going on, a political con game, and you and I are in the middle. It's time for you and me to wake up and start looking at it like it is, and trying to understand it like it is; and then we can deal with it like it is.

The Dixiecrats in Washington, D.C., control the key committees that run the government. The only reason the Dixiecrats control these committees is because they have seniority. The only reason they have seniority is because they come from states where Negroes can't vote. This is not even a government that's based on democracy. lt. is not a government that is made up of representatives of the people. Half of the people in the South can't even vote. Eastland is not even supposed to be in Washington. Half of the senators and congressmen who occupy these key positions in Washington, D.C., are there illegally, are there unconstitutionally.

I was in Washington, D.C., a week ago Thursday, when they were debating whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor. And in the back of the room where the Senate meets, there's a huge map of the United States, and on that map it shows the location of Negroes throughout the country. And it shows that the Southern section of the country, the states that are most heavily concentrated with Negroes, are the ones that have senators and congressmen standing up filibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery to keep the Negro from being able to vote. This is pitiful. But it's not pitiful for us any longer; it's actually pitiful for the white man, because soon now, as the Negro awakens a little more and sees the vise that he's in, sees the bag that he's in, sees the real game that he's in, then the Negro's going to develop a new tactic.

These senators and congressmen actually violate the constitutional amendments that guarantee the people of that particular state or county the right to vote. And the Constitution itself has within it the machinery to expel any representative from a state where the voting rights of the people are violated. You don't even need new legislation. Any person in Congress right now, who is there from a state or a district where the voting rights of the people are violated, that particular person should be expelled from Congress. And when you expel him, you've removed one of the obstacles in the path of any real meaningful legislation in this country. In fact, when you expel them, you don't need new legislation, because they will be replaced by black representatives from counties and districts where the black man is in the majority, not in the minority.

If the black man in these Southern states had his full voting rights, the key Dixiecrats in Washington, D. C., which means the key Democrats in Washington, D.C., would lose their seats. The Democratic Party itself would lose its power. It would cease to be powerful as a party. When you see the amount of power that would be lost by the Democratic Party if it were to lose the Dixiecrat wing, or branch, or element, you can see where it's against the interests of the Democrats to give voting rights to Negroes in states where the Democrats have been in complete power and authority ever since the Civil War. You just can't belong to that Party without analyzing it.
I say again, I'm not anti-Democrat, I'm not anti-Republican, I'm not anti-anything. I'm just questioning their sincerity, and some of the strategy that they've been using on our people by promising them promises that they don't intend to keep. When you keep the Democrats in power, you're keeping the Dixiecrats in power. I doubt that my good Brother Lomax will deny that. A vote for a Democrat is a vote for a Dixiecrat. That's why, in 1964, it's time now for you and me to become more politically mature and realize what the ballot is for; what we're supposed to get when we cast a ballot; and that if we don't cast a ballot, it's going to end up in a situation where we're going to have to cast a bullet. It's either a ballot or a bullet.

In the North, they do it a different way. They have a system that's known as gerrymandering, whatever that means. It means when Negroes become too heavily concentrated in a certain area, and begin to gain too much political power, the white man comes along and changes the district lines. You may say, "Why do you keep saying white man?" Because it's the white man who does it. I haven't ever seen any Negro changing any lines. They don't let him get near the line. It's the white man who does this. And usually, it's the white man who grins at you the most, and pats you on the back, and is supposed to be your friend. He may be friendly, but he's not your friend.

So, what I'm trying to impress upon you, in essence, is this: You and I in America are faced not with a segregationist conspiracy, we're faced with a government conspiracy. Everyone who's filibustering is a senator -- that's the government. Everyone who's finagling in Washington, D.C., is a congressman -- that's the government. You don't have anybody putting blocks in your path but people who are a part of the government. The same government that you go abroad to fight for and die for is the government that is in a conspiracy to deprive you of your voting rights, deprive you of your economic opportunities, deprive you of decent housing, deprive you of decent education. You don't need to go to the employer alone, it is the government itself, the government of America, that is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of black people in this country. And you should drop it in their lap. This government has failed the Negro. This so-called democracy has failed the Negro. And all these white liberals have definitely failed the Negro.

So, where do we go from here? First, we need some friends. We need some new allies. The entire civil-rights struggle needs a new interpretation, a broader interpretation. We need to look at this civil-rights thing from another angle -- from the inside as well as from the outside. To those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism, the only way you can get involved in the civil-rights struggle is give it a new interpretation. That old interpretation excluded us. It kept us out. So, we're giving a new interpretation to the civil-rights struggle, an interpretation that will enable us to come into it, take part in it. And these handkerchief-heads who have been dillydallying and pussy footing and compromising -- we don't intend to let them pussyfoot and dillydally and compromise any longer.

How can you thank a man for giving you what's already yours? How then can you thank him for giving you only part of what's already yours? You haven't even made progress, if what's being given to you, you should have had already. That's not progress. And I love my Brother Lomax, the way he pointed out we're right back where we were in 1954. We're not even as far up as we were in 1954. We're behind where we were in 1954. There's more segregation now than there was in 1954. There's more racial animosity, more racial hatred, more racial violence today in 1964, than there was in 1954. Where is the progress?

And now you're facing a situation where the young Negro's coming up. They don't want to hear that "turn the-other-cheek" stuff, no. In Jacksonville, those were teenagers, they were throwing Molotov cocktails. Negroes have never done that before. But it shows you there's a new deal coming in. There's new thinking coming in. There's new strategy coming in. It'll be Molotov cocktails this month, hand grenades next month, and something else next month. It'll be ballots, or it'll be bullets. It'll be liberty, or it will be death. The only difference about this kind of death -- it'll be reciprocal. You know what is meant by "reciprocal"? That's one of Brother Lomax's words. I stole it from him. I don't usually deal with those big words because I don't usually deal with big people. I deal with small people. I find you can get a whole lot of small people and whip hell out of a whole lot of big people. They haven't got anything to lose, and they've got every thing to gain. And they'll let you know in a minute: "It takes two to tango; when I go, you go."

The black nationalists, those whose philosophy is black nationalism, in bringing about this new interpretation of the entire meaning of civil rights, look upon it as meaning, as Brother Lomax has pointed out, equality of opportunity. Well, we're justified in seeking civil rights, if it means equality of opportunity, because all we're doing there is trying to collect for our investment. Our mothers and fathers invested sweat and blood. Three hundred and ten years we worked in this country without a dime in return -- I mean without a dime in return. You let the white man walk around here talking about how rich this country is, but you never stop to think how it got rich so quick. It got rich because you made it rich.

You take the people who are in this audience right now. They're poor. We're all poor as individuals. Our weekly salary individually amounts to hardly anything. But if you take the salary of everyone in here collectively, it'll fill up a whole lot of baskets. It's a lot of wealth. If you can collect the wages of just these people right here for a year, you'll be rich -- richer than rich. When you look at it like that, think how rich Uncle Sam had to become, not with this handful, but millions of black people. Your and my mother and father, who didn't work an eight-hour shift, but worked from "can't see" in the morning until "can't see" at night, and worked for nothing, making the white man rich, making Uncle Sam rich. This is our investment. This is our contribution, our blood.

Not only did we give of our free labor, we gave of our blood. Every time he had a call to arms, we were the first ones in uniform. We died on every battlefield the white man had. We have made a greater sacrifice than anybody who's standing up in America today. We have made a greater contribution and have collected less. Civil rights, for those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism, means: "Give it to us now. Don't wait for next year. Give it to us yesterday, and that's not fast enough."

I might stop right here to point out one thing. Whenever you're going after something that belongs to you, anyone who's depriving you of the right to have it is a criminal. Understand that. Whenever you are going after something that is yours, you are within your legal rights to lay claim to it. And anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that which is yours, is breaking the law, is a criminal. And this was pointed out by the Supreme Court decision. It outlawed segregation.

Which means segregation is against the law. Which means a segregationist is breaking the law. A segregationist is a criminal. You can't label him as anything other than that. And when you demonstrate against segregation, the law is on your side. The Supreme Court is on your side.

Now, who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law? The police department itself. With police dogs and clubs. Whenever you demonstrate against segregation, whether it is segregated education, segregated housing, or anything else, the law is on your side, and anyone who stands in the way is not the law any longer. They are breaking the law; they are not representatives of the law. Any time you demonstrate against segregation and a man has the audacity to put a police dog on you, kill that dog, kill him, I'm telling you, kill that dog. I say it, if they put me in jail tomorrow, kill that dog. Then you'll put a stop to it. Now, if these white people in here don't want to see that kind of action, get down and tell the mayor to tell the police department to pull the dogs in. That's all you have to do. If you don't do it, someone else will.

If you don't take this kind of stand, your little children will grow up and look at you and think "shame." If you don't take an uncompromising stand, I don't mean go out and get violent; but at the same time you should never be nonviolent unless you run into some nonviolence. I'm nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me. But when you drop that violence on me, then you've made me go insane, and I'm not responsible for what I do. And that's the way every Negro should get. Any time you know you're within the law, within your legal rights, within your moral rights, in accord with justice, then die for what you believe in. But don't die alone. Let your dying be reciprocal. This is what is meant by equality. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
When we begin to get in this area, we need new friends, we need new allies. We need to expand the civil-rights struggle to a higher level -- to the level of human rights. Whenever you are in a civil-rights struggle, whether you know it or not, you are confining yourself to the jurisdiction of Uncle Sam. No one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is a civil-rights struggle. Civil rights comes within the domestic affairs of this country. All of our African brothers and our Asian brothers and our Latin-American brothers cannot open their mouths and interfere in the domestic affairs of the United States. And as long as it's civil rights, this comes under the jurisdiction of Uncle Sam.

But the United Nations has what's known as the charter of human rights; it has a committee that deals in human rights. You may wonder why all of the atrocities that have been committed in Africa and in Hungary and in Asia, and in Latin America are brought before the UN, and the Negro problem is never brought before the UN. This is part of the conspiracy. This old, tricky blue eyed liberal who is supposed to be your and my friend, supposed to be in our corner, supposed to be subsidizing our struggle, and supposed to be acting in the capacity of an adviser, never tells you anything about human rights. They keep you wrapped up in civil rights. And you spend so much time barking up the civil-rights tree, you don't even know there's a human-rights tree on the same floor.

When you expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights, you can then take the case of the black man in this country before the nations in the UN. You can take it before the General Assembly. You can take Uncle Sam before a world court. But the only level you can do it on is the level of human rights. Civil rights keeps you under his restrictions, under his jurisdiction. Civil rights keeps you in his pocket. Civil rights means you're asking Uncle Sam to treat you right. Human rights are something you were born with. Human rights are your God-given rights. Human rights are the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth. And any time any one violates your human rights, you can take them to the world court.

Uncle Sam's hands are dripping with blood, dripping with the blood of the black man in this country. He's the earth's number-one hypocrite. He has the audacity -- yes, he has -- imagine him posing as the leader of the free world. The free world! And you over here singing "We Shall Overcome." Expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights. Take it into the United Nations, where our African brothers can throw their weight on our side, where our Asian brothers can throw their weight on our side, where our Latin-American brothers can throw their weight on our side, and where 800 million Chinamen are sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side.

Let the world know how bloody his hands are. Let the world know the hypocrisy that's practiced over here. Let it be the ballot or the bullet. Let him know that it must be the ballot or the bullet.

When you take your case to Washington, D.C., you're taking it to the criminal who's responsible; it's like running from the wolf to the fox. They're all in cahoots together. They all work political chicanery and make you look like a chump before the eyes of the world. Here you are walking around in America, getting ready to be drafted and sent abroad, like a tin soldier, and when you get over there, people ask you what are you fighting for, and you have to stick your tongue in your cheek. No, take Uncle Sam to court, take him before the world.

By ballot I only mean freedom. Don't you know -- I disagree with Lomax on this issue -- that the ballot is more important than the dollar? Can I prove it? Yes. Look in the UN. There are poor nations in the UN; yet those poor nations can get together with their voting power and keep the rich nations from making a move. They have one nation -- one vote, everyone has an equal vote. And when those brothers from Asia, and Africa and the darker parts of this earth get together, their voting power is sufficient to hold Sam in check. Or Russia in check. Or some other section of the earth in check. So, the ballot is most important.

Right now, in this country, if you and I, 22 million African-Americans -- that's what we are -- Africans who are in America. You're nothing but Africans. Nothing but Africans. In fact, you'd get farther calling yourself African instead of Negro. Africans don't catch hell. You're the only one catching hell. They don't have to pass civil-rights bills for Africans. An African can go anywhere he wants right now. All you've got to do is tie your head up. That's right, go anywhere you want. Just stop being a Negro. Change your name to Hoogagagooba. That'll show you how silly the white man is. You're dealing with a silly man. A friend of mine who's very dark put a turban on his head and went into a restaurant in Atlanta before they called themselves desegregated. He went into a white restaurant, he sat down, they served him, and he said, "What would happen if a Negro came in here? And there he's sitting, black as night, but because he had his head wrapped up the waitress looked back at him and says, "Why, there wouldn't no nigger dare come in here."

So, you're dealing with a man whose bias and prejudice are making him lose his mind, his intelligence, every day. He's frightened. He looks around and sees what's taking place on this earth, and he sees that the pendulum of time is swinging in your direction. The dark people are waking up. They're losing their fear of the white man. No place where he's fighting right now is he winning. Everywhere he's fighting, he's fighting someone your and my complexion. And they're beating him. He can't win any more. He's won his last battle. He failed to win the Korean War. He couldn't win it. He had to sign a truce. That's a loss.

Any time Uncle Sam, with all his machinery for warfare, is held to a draw by some rice eaters, he's lost the battle. He had to sign a truce. America's not supposed to sign a truce. She's supposed to be bad. But she's not bad any more. She's bad as long as she can use her hydrogen bomb, but she can't use hers for fear Russia might use hers. Russia can't use hers, for fear that Sam might use his. So, both of them are weapon-less. They can't use the weapon because each's weapon nullifies the other's. So the only place where action can take place is on the ground. And the white man can't win another war fighting on the ground. Those days are over The black man knows it, the brown man knows it, the red man knows it, and the yellow man knows it. So they engage him in guerrilla warfare. That's not his style. You've got to have heart to be a guerrilla warrior, and he hasn't got any heart. I'm telling you now.

I just want to give you a little briefing on guerrilla warfare because, before you know it, before you know it. It takes heart to be a guerrilla warrior because you're on your own. In conventional warfare you have tanks and a whole lot of other people with you to back you up -- planes over your head and all that kind of stuff. But a guerrilla is on his own. All you have is a rifle, some sneakers and a bowl of rice, and that's all you need -- and a lot of heart. The Japanese on some of those islands in the Pacific, when the American soldiers landed, one Japanese sometimes could hold the whole army off. He'd just wait until the sun went down, and when the sun went down they were all equal. He would take his little blade and slip from bush to bush, and from American to American. The white soldiers couldn't cope with that. Whenever you see a white soldier that fought in the Pacific, he has the shakes, he has a nervous condition, because they scared him to death.

The same thing happened to the French up in French Indochina. People who just a few years previously were rice farmers got together and ran the heavily-mechanized French army out of Indochina. You don't need it -- modern warfare today won't work. This is the day of the guerrilla. They did the same thing in Algeria. Algerians, who were nothing but Bedouins, took a rine and sneaked off to the hills, and de Gaulle and all of his highfalutin' war machinery couldn't defeat those guerrillas. Nowhere on this earth does the white man win in a guerrilla warfare. It's not his speed. Just as guerrilla warfare is prevailing in Asia and in parts of Africa and in parts of Latin America, you've got to be mighty naive, or you've got to play the black man cheap, if you don't think some day he's going to wake up and find that it's got to be the ballot or the bullet.

L would like to say, in closing, a few things concerning the Muslim Mosque, Inc., which we established recently in New York City. It's true we're Muslims and our religion is Islam, but we don't mix our religion with our politics and our economics and our social and civil activities -- not any more We keep our religion in our mosque. After our religious services are over, then as Muslims we become involved in political action, economic action and social and civic action. We become involved with anybody, any where, any time and in any manner that's designed to eliminate the evils, the political, economic and social evils that are afflicting the people of our community.

The political philosophy of black nationalism means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community; no more. The black man in the black community has to be re-educated into the science of politics so he will know what politics is supposed to bring him in return. Don't be throwing out any ballots. A ballot is like a bullet. You don't throw your ballots until you see a target, and if that target is not within your reach, keep your ballot in your pocket.

The political philosophy of black nationalism is being taught in the Christian church. It's being taught in the NAACP. It's being taught in CORE meetings. It's being taught in SNCC Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee meetings. It's being taught in Muslim meetings. It's being taught where nothing but atheists and agnostics come together. It's being taught everywhere. Black people are fed up with the dillydallying, pussyfooting, compromising approach that we've been using toward getting our freedom. We want freedom now, but we're not going to get it saying "We Shall Overcome." We've got to fight until we overcome.

The economic philosophy of black nationalism is pure and simple. It only means that we should control the economy of our community. Why should white people be running all the stores in our community? Why should white people be running the banks of our community? Why should the economy of our community be in the hands of the white man? Why? If a black man can't move his store into a white community, you tell me why a white man should move his store into a black community. The philosophy of black nationalism involves a re-education program in the black community in regards to economics. Our people have to be made to see that any time you take your dollar out of your community and spend it in a community where you don't live, the community where you live will get poorer and poorer, and the community where you spend your money will get richer and richer.

Then you wonder why where you live is always a ghetto or a slum area. And where you and I are concerned, not only do we lose it when we spend it out of the community, but the white man has got all our stores in the community tied up; so that though we spend it in the community, at sundown the man who runs the store takes it over across town somewhere. He's got us in a vise. So the economic philosophy of black nationalism means in every church, in every civic organization, in every fraternal order, it's time now for our people to be come conscious of the importance of controlling the economy of our community. If we own the stores, if we operate the businesses, if we try and establish some industry in our own community, then we're developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind. Once you gain control of the economy of your own community, then you don't have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business.

The social philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to get together and remove the evils, the vices, alcoholism, drug addiction, and other evils that are destroying the moral fiber of our community. We our selves have to lift the level of our community, the standard of our community to a higher level, make our own society beautiful so that we will be satisfied in our own social circles and won't be running around here trying to knock our way into a social circle where we're not wanted. So I say, in spreading a gospel such as black nationalism, it is not designed to make the black man re-evaluate the white man -- you know him already -- but to make the black man re-evaluate himself. Don't change the white man's mind -- you can't change his mind, and that whole thing about appealing to the moral conscience of America -- America's conscience is bankrupt. She lost all conscience a long time ago. Uncle Sam has no conscience.

They don't know what morals are. They don't try and eliminate an evil because it's evil, or because it's illegal, or because it's immoral; they eliminate it only when it threatens their existence. So you're wasting your time appealing to the moral conscience of a bankrupt man like Uncle Sam. If he had a conscience, he'd straighten this thing out with no more pressure being put upon him. So it is not necessary to change the white man's mind. We have to change our own mind. You can't change his mind about us. We've got to change our own minds about each other. We have to see each other with new eyes. We have to see each other as brothers and sisters. We have to come together with warmth so we can develop unity and harmony that's necessary to get this problem solved ourselves. How can we do this? How can we avoid jealousy? How can we avoid the suspicion and the divisions that exist in the community? I'll tell you how.

I have watched how Billy Graham comes into a city, spreading what he calls the gospel of Christ, which is only white nationalism. That's what he is. Billy Graham is a white nationalist; I'm a black nationalist. But since it's the natural tendency for leaders to be jealous and look upon a powerful figure like Graham with suspicion and envy, how is it possible for him to come into a city and get all the cooperation of the church leaders? Don't think because they're church leaders that they don't have weaknesses that make them envious and jealous -- no, everybody's got it. It's not an accident that when they want to choose a cardinal, as Pope I over there in Rome, they get in a closet so you can't hear them cussing and fighting and carrying on.

Billy Graham comes in preaching the gospel of Christ. He evangelizes the gospel. He stirs everybody up, but he never tries to start a church. If he came in trying to start a church, all the churches would be against him. So, he just comes in talking about Christ and tells everybody who gets Christ to go to any church where Christ is; and in this way the church cooperates with him. So we're going to take a page from his book.

Our gospel is black nationalism. We're not trying to threaten the existence of any organization, but we're spreading the gospel of black nationalism. Anywhere there's a church that is also preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join that church. If the NAACP is preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join the NAACP. If CORE is spreading and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join CORE. Join any organization that has a gospel that's for the uplift of the black man. And when you get into it and see them pussyfooting or compromising, pull out of it because that's not black nationalism. We'll find another one.

And in this manner, the organizations will increase in number and in quantity and in quality, and by August, it is then our intention to have a black nationalist convention which will consist of delegates from all over the country who are interested in the political, economic and social philosophy of black nationalism. After these delegates convene, we will hold a seminar; we will hold discussions; we will listen to everyone. We want to hear new ideas and new solutions and new answers. And at that time, if we see fit then to form a black nationalist party, we'll form a black nationalist party. If it's necessary to form a black nationalist army, we'll form a black nationalist army. It'll be the ballot or the bullet. It'll be liberty or it'll be death.

It's time for you and me to stop sitting in this country, letting some cracker senators, Northern crackers and Southern crackers, sit there in Washington, D.C., and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and I are supposed to have civil rights. There's no white man going to tell me anything about my rights. Brothers and sisters, always remember, if it doesn't take senators and congressmen and presidential proclamations to give freedom to the white man, it is not necessary for legislation or proclamation or Supreme Court decisions to give freedom to the black man. You let that white man know, if this is a country of freedom, let it be a country of freedom; and if it's not a country of freedom, change it.

We will work with anybody, anywhere, at any time, who is genuinely interested in tackling the problem head-on, nonviolently as long as the enemy is nonviolent, but violent when the enemy gets violent. We'll work with you on the voter-registration drive, we'll work with you on rent strikes, we'll work with you on school boycotts; I don't believe in any kind of integration; I'm not even worried about it, because I know you're not going to get it anyway; you're not going to get it because you're afraid to die; you've got to be ready to die if you try and force yourself on the white man, because he'll get just as violent as those crackers in Mississippi, right here in Cleveland. But we will still work with you on the school boycotts be cause we're against a segregated school system. A segregated school system produces children who, when they graduate, graduate with crippled minds. But this does not mean that a school is segregated because it's all black. A segregated school means a school that is controlled by people who have no real interest in it whatsoever.

Let me explain what I mean. A segregated district or community is a community in which people live, but outsiders control the politics and the economy of that community. They never refer to the white section as a segregated community. It's the all-Negro section that's a segregated community. Why? The white man controls his own school, his own bank, his own economy, his own politics, his own everything, his own community; but he also controls yours. When you're under someone else's control, you're segregated. They'll always give you the lowest or the worst that there is to offer, but it doesn't mean you're segregated just because you have your own. You've got to control your own. Just like the white man has control of his, you need to control yours.

You know the best way to get rid of segregation? The white man is more afraid of separation than he is of integration. Segregation means that he puts you away from him, but not far enough for you to be out of his jurisdiction; separation means you're gone. And the white man will integrate faster than he'll let you separate. So we will work with you against the segregated school system because it's criminal, because it is absolutely destructive, in every way imaginable, to the minds of the children who have to be exposed to that type of crippling education.

Last but not least, I must say this concerning the great controversy over rifles and shotguns. The only thing that I've ever said is that in areas where the government has proven itself either unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of Negroes, it's time for Negroes to defend themselves. Article number two of the constitutional amendments provides you and me the right to own a rifle or a shotgun. It is constitutionally legal to own a shotgun or a rifle. This doesn't mean you're going to get a rifle and form battalions and go out looking for white folks, although you'd be within your rights -- I mean, you'd be justified; but that would be illegal and we don't do anything illegal. If the white man doesn't want the black man buying rifles and shotguns, then let the government do its job.

That's all. And don't let the white man come to you and ask you what you think about what Malcolm says -- why, you old Uncle Tom. He would never ask you if he thought you were going to say, "Amen!" No, he is making a Tom out of you." So, this doesn't mean forming rifle clubs and going out looking for people, but it is time, in 1964, if you are a man, to let that man know. If he's not going to do his job in running the government and providing you and me with the protection that our taxes are supposed to be for, since he spends all those billions for his defense budget, he certainly can't begrudge you and me spending $12 or $15 for a single-shot, or double-action. I hope you understand. Don't go out shooting people, but any time -- brothers and sisters, and especially the men in this audience; some of you wearing Congressional Medals of Honor, with shoulders this wide, chests this big, muscles that big -- any time you and I sit around and read where they bomb a church and murder in cold blood, not some grownups, but four little girls while they were praying to the same God the white man taught them to pray to, and you and I see the government go down and can't find who did it.

Why, this man -- he can find Eichmann hiding down in Argentina somewhere. Let two or three American soldiers, who are minding somebody else's business way over in South Vietnam, get killed, and he'll send battleships, sticking his nose in their business. He wanted to send troops down to Cuba and make them have what he calls free elections -- this old cracker who doesn't have free elections in his own country.

No, if you never see me another time in your life, if I die in the morning, I'll die saying one thing: the ballot or the bullet, the ballot or the bullet.

If a Negro in 1964 has to sit around and wait for some cracker senator to filibuster when it comes to the rights of black people, why, you and I should hang our heads in shame. You talk about a march on Washington in 1963, you haven't seen anything. There's some more going down in '64.

And this time they're not going like they went last year. They're not going singing ''We Shall Overcome." They're not going with white friends. They're not going with placards already painted for them. They're not going with round-trip tickets. They're going with one way tickets. And if they don't want that non-nonviolent army going down there, tell them to bring the filibuster to a halt.

The black nationalists aren't going to wait. Lyndon B. Johnson is the head of the Democratic Party. If he's for civil rights, let him go into the Senate next week and declare himself. Let him go in there right now and declare himself. Let him go in there and denounce the Southern branch of his party. Let him go in there right now and take a moral stand -- right now, not later. Tell him, don't wait until election time. If he waits too long, brothers and sisters, he will be responsible for letting a condition develop in this country which will create a climate that will bring seeds up out of the ground with vegetation on the end of them looking like something these people never dreamed of. In 1964, it's the ballot or the bullet.

After spending a long day finding this place
I feel like I am lost

Please don't, please don't leave
Don’t know why Don’t know why
It's not even raining but outside the window
You grow white and farther apart

Letting you go
Is not as easy as it sounds
I turn away, not being able to see you leave me
Tears eventually drop and I need to wipe them away now
I don’t know whether I should use
The handkerchief you gave me or throw it away
Why won't this trembling go away?
I pretend to be crazy and hold onto you but
My body won't listen to me
Intoxicated with the scent of you in the car
I don't want to wake up forever

Please don’t (please) don't leave please (please)
Come back (come back) come back (come back)
On top of the empty seat you left
Only your cold scent remains

Please don't, please don't leave
Come back (come back) come back (come back)
I will hold onto the remaining scent
So come back to your placeEmbedBTS - You Never Walk Alone Thanks To Notes (English Translation) LyricsMembersJin | Suga | Rap Monster | J-Hope | Jimin | V | JungkookJin

The people who produce our contents, Yoojung noona, Surin noona, Hyunji-nim, Boonhong-nim (Pink-nim?), and Nayeob-nim, it must be hard producing contents. Let's go eat pizza!!

And those in charge of our concerts, Hayan-nim, Hyeyoung-nim, and Jinah-nim, you always stay up all night planning... Let's go eat eel, which is good for your body.

And distribution's Heesoon-nim, Kyungjin-nim, global Sungho-nim, and Hyojin-nim, I know that it's hard for you all even if you aren't on the scene with us often. Let's have a company meal/get-together!!

Thank you for always liking us so much, you've had many hard times, and you've worked hard by taking our side. At each of those moments, I'm very thankful and I love you.

In this album that we are releasing at the start of
the New Year, I want to ask that you take care of
us this year as well.

First, my family. I miss you and want to take care
of you from beside you, but I'm sorry that I can't do
that. My family who I love, please don’t ever forget
that I love you. Thank you, always.

Our members, Namjoonie hyung. Seokjinie hyung,
Hoseokie hyung, Yoongi hyung, Taehyungie, Jeonggukie. Thinking about it, we’re already about
to enter our 5th year (since debut). I always feel this, but I think I can be strong just from looking at
you guys who are always beside me. We used to not match/mix well, but now I often think that we’re like real brothers. I want to express my gratitude to all of you who make all the work that I do feel more enjoyable. I love you.

The hyungnims who I treasure and love: Timo hyung, Sungwoon hyung, Taeminie hyung,
Kwonho hyung, Jonginie hyung. Since I see you
as often as I see my members, it might be
embarrassing to see words like this written here,
but everyday is fun because of you hyungs. Now
let the maknae buy a meal. I love you.

A.R.M.Y.

We're already approaching the start of our 5th
year (since debut). Time goes by so~ fast, doesn’t
it. I also wonder when time flew by so quickly.

Don’t worry. There’s still so much we have to show
you, so starting with this album, I think we’ll spend this year together. Let's start this album and spend
this year pleasantly. Have a happy new year. don’t
get sick, and I hope everyone can be happy. I love
you!

I love all of you who are always with us.
Sincerely, Jimin.V

Now I will write a whole letter for all the people I love

I’II hold it in and work diligently to become my grandmother's grandson, a pretty grandson, so please watch over me. Have a happy new year (receive lots of fortune) and thank you for raising me all this time. I love you.

[Chorus]
멀어져만 가는 그대, you're the only one
내가 사랑했던 것만큼, you're the only one
아프고 아프지만 바보 같지만 goodbye
다시 널 못 본다 해도, you're the only one, only one

[Verse 1]
어색하게 마주앉아
사소한 얘기로 안부를 묻고
가끔 대화가 끊기는 순간에는
차가운 정적 우릴 얼게 만들어 (만들어)
[Pre-Chorus]
지금 이 자리에서 우리는 남이 되겠지
어느 누군가는 눈물 흘리며 남겠지만
상처주지 않으려고 자꾸 애를 써가면서
눈치 보는 니 모습 싫어, so I'll let you go, oh

[Chorus]
내사랑 이제는 안녕, you're the only one (You're the only one)
이별하는 이순간에도, you're the only one
아프고 아프지만 바보 같지만 goodbye (Oh, oh)
다시 널 못 본다 해도, you're the only one, only one

[Interlude]
You're the only one (Only one)

[Verse 2]
갑작스런 나의 말에
왠지 모르게 넌 안심한듯해
어디서부터 우린 이렇게 잘못된 걸까?
오래 전부터 다른 곳만 기대한 건 아닌지, whoa (Whoa)

[Pre-Chorus]
너무 다른 시작과 끝의 그 날카로움이 (Ah)
내 심장을 찌르는 아픔은 왜 똑같은지
벅찬 가슴이 한 순간에 공허하게 무너져서 (Ah, whoa)
이런 내 모습 어떻게 일어설까

다시 널 못 본다 해도, you're the only one (You're the only one)

[Post-Chorus]
내 머릿속은 언제쯤 너를 지울까 (I will let you go)
하루 이틀 한달, 멀게는 아마 몇 년쯤 (My baby, can't forget)
그리고 언젠가 너의 기억 속에는 (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
나란 사람은 더 이상 살지 않겠지 지우겠지

떠난 너 때문에 울지 않을래

더 멋진 남잘 만나
꼭 보여줄게 너보다 행복한 나
너 없이도 슬프지 않아 무너지지 않아
Boy you gotta be aware1Embed하루 끝 (Every End of the Day) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Monday better day
처음처럼 설레이는
그런 날
Sunday better day
종일 너만 생각하는
그런 날

[Verse 2]
욕심이 나 우리 사이
요만큼만 더 가까이
딱 한 발짝
그만큼 더 가까이
혼잣말이 속삭임이
너도 궁금할 순 있잖아
[Chorus]
네가 좋아서 그래
나 차가운 척
표정 짓고 있지만
내 마음은 그게 아닌데
거짓말인데
바보 같은 네가 난 답답해

너무 좋아서 그래
나 시무룩한
얼굴하고 있지만
또 기다리다 고민만 하다
흘러가는 하루 끝에서
하는 말
내가 널 사랑해

[Verse 3]
One day holiday
혼자 있긴 너무너무
싫은 날
One day cloudy day
울 것처럼 하늘도
찌푸린 날

[Verse 4]
눈물이 와 서글픈
내 맘을 닮은
눈물이 와
꾹 참았다
쏟아지는 내 맘이
온 하늘에 온 세상에
그저 슬픈 건 아닐 거야

너무 좋아서 그래
나 시무룩한

또 기다리다 고민만 하다
흘러가는 하루 끝에서

내가 널 사랑해

[Bridge]
내 입술엔 거짓말
내 눈 속엔 정말 하고픈 말
맘속에 숨어 있는 말

[Chorus]
많이 좋아서 그래
뒤돌아서 느려진
발걸음을 봐
널 기다리는 맘인 거잖아
날 지켜본 너라면 알잖아
내가 몰라서 그래
네 마음이 들리게
내게 말해줘
손 내밀면 될 것 같은데
망설이는 이유가
나와 같다면
이제 다가와 줘EmbedBeautiful Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
Someone's gone out fishing, someone's high and dry
Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
And I'm left stranded, wondering why

[Verse 2]
You and me together, nothing feels so good
Even if I get a medal from my local neighbourhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles
And I'm still stranded, wondering why
[Chorus]
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold

[Verse 3]
Some boat's on the ocean, we're here in this room
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon
We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky
No more wondering, wondering why

[Bridge]
Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump in the dead of the night
So let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

[Chorus]
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
Such a beautiful night for love
Such a wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Yeah, it's beautiful night
Yeah, it's beautiful night
Ah

Away, on your way, thank youEmbedTwinkle LyricsThe twinkle, twinkle
The twinkle, twinkle

숨겨도 twinkle 어쩌나
눈에 확 띄잖아
베일에 싸여 있어도
나는 twinkle 티가 나

딴 사람들도 다
빛나는 나를 좋아해
끝까지 경계해야 해
보석을 훔친 너잖아
늘 나의 곁을 지켜줘
내 주위만 맴돌아
눈을 떼지 말아줘
내 매력에 빠져

숨겨도 twinkle 어쩌나
눈에 확 띄잖아
베일에 싸여 있어도
나는 twinkle 티가 나

난 미지의 세계
시간을 잊어버릴걸
아침에 눈을 떠봐도
꿈은 계속될 거야

난 너를 위해 꾸미고
더 예쁘게 날 반짝일래
왜 너만 혼자 몰라
나의 진가를

숨겨도 twinkle 어쩌나
(숨겨도 twinkle 빛이나)
눈에 확 띄잖아
베일에 싸여 있어도
나는 twinkle 티가 나
You might also like너무 태연해 너무 뻔뻔해
밖에는 날 소원하는 줄이 끝이 안 보여
말도 안되게 넌 너무 담담해
난 하늘 아래 떨어진 별

숨겨도 twinkle 어쩌나
눈에 확 띄잖아
베일에 싸여 있어도
나는 twinkle 티가 나

그대의 twinkle 나를 봐
어딜 봐 나를 봐
칙칙한 옷 속에서도
나는 twinkle 태가 나

숨겨도 twinkle 어쩌나
눈에 확 띄잖아
베일에 싸여 있어도
나는 twinkle 티가 나

The twinkle 알잖아Embed바람기억 (Memory of the Wind) Lyrics[Hangul]

[Verse 1]
바람 불어와 내 맘 흔들면
지나간 세월에 두 눈을 감아본다
나를 스치는 고요한 떨림
그 작은 소리에
난 귀를 기울여 본다

[Bridge]
내 안에 숨쉬는
커버린 삶의 조각들이
날 부딪혀 지날 때
그 곳을 바라보리라
[Chorus]
우리의 믿음 우리의 사랑
그 영원한 약속들을
나 추억한다면 힘차게 걸으리라
우리의 만남 우리의 이별
그 바래진 기억에
나 사랑했다면 미소를 띄우리라

[Bridge]
내 안에 있는
모자란 삶의 기억들이
날 부딪혀 지날 때
그 곳을 바라보리라

[Chorus]
우리의 믿음 우리의 사랑
그 영원한 약속들을
나 추억한다면 힘차게 걸으리라
우리의 만남 우리의 이별
그 바래진 기억에
나 사랑했다면 미소를 띄우리라

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.

THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.


THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!

THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.

(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

CISSY CAFFREY



I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)

THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.

CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.

(She sings.)
I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.

PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!

CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)

She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.


(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.
STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.

(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)

LYNCH So that?

STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!

STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

LYNCH Ba!

STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.

LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)

BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)

BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)

THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?

THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.

BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)

BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)

BLOOM O!

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.

(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.

BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.

RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?

BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.

RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.

RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!

BLOOM Mamma!

ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!

BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

BLOOM Molly!

MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)

MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...

MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.

BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

THE SOAP

We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.


(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

SWENY Three and a penny, please.

BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

MARION (Softly.) Poldy!

BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)

BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)

BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.

BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.

(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

MRS BREEN Mr.

BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!

BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.


(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.

BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.

MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.

MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.

BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.

(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

RICHIE Best value in Dub.

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.

RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!

BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.

MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.

BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?

MRS BREEN Let's.

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

THE BAWD Jewman's melt!

BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.

BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.

BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .

MRS BREEN Too.

BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .

MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!

PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.

THE NAVVY (Shouts.)

We are the boys. Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.

THENAVVY (Shouts.)

The galling chain.
And free our native land.


(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.

(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)

Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.

BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.

(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)

THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.

(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)

FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.

BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)

THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.

BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)

SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.

BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.

FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.

FIRST WATCH Proof.

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)

BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.

FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.

SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.

BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.

MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.

FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.

BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.

SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

FIRST WATCH Regiment.

BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?

BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.

FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.

BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.

BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.


BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.

BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.

BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.

FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.

BLOOM She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!

(General laughter.)

GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.

BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)

Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...


(He is howled down.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

BLOOM A penny in the pound.

(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.

(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.

MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.

BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.

MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!

BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.

BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?

BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.

(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.

(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)

THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)

Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo


(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.

(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)

THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.

THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?

THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.

THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.

FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.

SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.

THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)

THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)

LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?

(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.

(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .

HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.

SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?

PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!

BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.

SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?

FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.

PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.

A VOICE O rocks.

PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.

(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.

PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.

(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!

JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.

(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)

BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?

BLOOM Not I!

ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)

ZOE How's the nuts?

BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.

ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.

BLOOM Not likely.

ZOE I feel it.

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)

BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)

ZOE You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.

BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.

ZOE And you know what thought did?

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?

ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!

BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

BLOOM'S BOYS

The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.


A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.

A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!

(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)

A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?

A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!

A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!

A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.

(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)

THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

ALL God save Leopold the First!

BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.

WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.

MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!

(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.

(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)

JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!

BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!

JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.

A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!

AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.

AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.

BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)

(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)

THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)

THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.


(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)


BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.


BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!


THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!


(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)


BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.


(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)


JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.


PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?


BLOOM Pay them, my friend.


PADDY LEONARD Thank you.


NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?


BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.


J.J. O'MOLLY A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O'Brien!


NOSEY FLYNN Where do I draw the five pounds?

CHRIS CALLINAN What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of Aldebaran?

BLOOM Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.

JOE HYNES Why aren't you in uniform?

BLOOM When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?

BEN DOLLARD Pansies?

BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.

BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?

BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.

LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.

CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.

BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.

ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?

BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.

O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.

DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!

BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?

(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)

FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.

MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!

MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!

NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.

BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)

I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.


HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.

PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!

BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)

LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!

THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.

BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.

THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.

THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)

(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.

MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?

BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.

BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.

BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

A FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?

A HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?

BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!

(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)

THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!


THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

If you see kay
Tell him he may
See you in tea
Tell him from me.


HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)

MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!

(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)

MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.

BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!

(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)

REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.

THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!

BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)

THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!

BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.

(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)

ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.

BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.

ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.

BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.

ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?

ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?

BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.

ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.

BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.

ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.

BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE Babby!

BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.

ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)

THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)

ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.

BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.

ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!

ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?

LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!

ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?

THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!

STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

THE CAP Bah!

STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)

STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!

LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)

FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY No!

ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!

FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)

STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

ALL What?

THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)

FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)

THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)

ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...

THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!

ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.

ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.

STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.

(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)

THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.

ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

LYNCH I'm not looking.

ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)

VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

BLOOM She is rather lean.

VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.

VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.

VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

BLOOM With?...

VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.

BLOOM The stye I dislike.

VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.

(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.

BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?

VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...

VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.

VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.

I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!


(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.

FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.

STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?

FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)

PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?

(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?

FLORRY And the song?

STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.

STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.

ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.

VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!

LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM Poor man!

ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.

BLOOM How?

VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.

KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?

PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.

(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)

LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.

ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.

LYNCH Three wise virgins.

VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.

(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!

A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.

HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.

VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

HENRY All is lost now.

(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.

LYNCH All one and the same God to her.

STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.

STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.

(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

THE CARDINAL

Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.


(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

(The trick doorhandle turns.)

THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

ZOE The devil is in that door.

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)

ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?

ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)

BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.

ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)

THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.

BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.

BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.

THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?

BLOOM Yes. No.

THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.

THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.

BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.

THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.

BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?

THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!

BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!

BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!

BELLO Dungdevourer!

BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.

BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!

BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.

BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.

BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.

FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.

KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.

BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

BELLO (Twisting.) Another!

BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!

BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)

BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)

BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.

ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.

BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.

BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?

BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !

BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.

BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)

BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

A BIDDER A florin!

(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

A VOICE One and eightpence too much.

THE LACQUEY Barang!

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?

BLOOM Eccles Street.

BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!

BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.

BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.

BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...

BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)

SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!

BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.

BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!

BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.

BLOOM They... I

BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...

A VOICE Swear!

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?

(He bites his thumb.)

BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!

BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)

BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)

THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.

VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)

THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.

THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.

THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?

THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.

BLOOM You understood them?

THE YEWS Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!

BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.

(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)

THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!

(They cheer.)

BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO Fool!

THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?

THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.


THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!

BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!

BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)

THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...

BLOOM Done. Prff.

THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?

BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.

BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!

THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.

THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!

BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.

THE WATERFALL

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!

THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)

THE BUTTON Bip!

(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

THE SLUTS

O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.


BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!

THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!

BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !

BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)

BELLA You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.

BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!

BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?

ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)

BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

ZOE

Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.


BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.

STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.

BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.

STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.

BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)

BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!

KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)

FLORRY And me?

LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.

BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.

BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.

ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)

BLOOM This is yours.

STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.

BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.

STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?

STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.

BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM No, but...

STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?

ZOE Is he hungry?

STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)

Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.


ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.

LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)

LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.

(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)

FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.

(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.

ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.

STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE What day were you born?

STEPHEN Thursday. Today.

ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.

FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.

ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?

BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.

BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.

ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.

BLOOM Wrong.

ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?

(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.

(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.

ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?

(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

FLORRY What?

(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)

THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?

(Bronze by gold they whisper.)

ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.

(They whisper again.)

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)

LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.

LENEHAN A good night's work.

BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.

LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!

ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.

BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?

BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?

BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.

MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!

BELLA What? What is it?

(Zoe whispers to her.)

MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.

BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.

BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...

KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!

LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.

BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!

BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!

LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!

BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?

ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.

BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM

(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!

STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.

BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.

LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.

ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous. Misters very selects for is pleasure must to visit heaven and hell show with mortuary candles and they tears silver which occur every night. Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!

LYNCH Vive le vampire!

THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!

STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.

BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...

STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)

BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...

THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!

STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.

ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.

LYNCH Across the world for a wife.

FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.

STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?

BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.

STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!

BLOOM I say, look...

STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!

(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

THE CROWD

Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!


(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!

GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!

(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)

STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!

ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY

Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...


ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?

BLOOM Who'll.

LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.

STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?

(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

HOURS You may touch my.

CAVALIERS May I touch your?

HOURS O, but lightly!

CAVALIERS O, so lightly!

THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!

(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!

ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!

MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!

(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

ZOE I'm giddy.

(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)

MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)

MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!

THE PIANOLA

Best, best of all,
Baraabum!


KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!

(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)

STEPHEN Pas seul!

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

THE PIANOLA

Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.


(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)

TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!

SIMON Think of your mother's people!

STEPHEN Dance of death.

(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion.

Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)

(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)

STEPHEN Ho!

(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

THE CHOIR

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...


(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.


THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.


STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?


BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.


THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.


STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.


THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.


STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.


THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.


STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!


THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!


FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.


BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.


THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!


STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!


THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)


STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)


BLOOM (At the window.) What?


STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!


FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)


THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!


STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!


THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.


STEPHEN Nothung!


(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


THE GASJET Pwfungg!


BLOOM Stop!


LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!


BELLA Police!


(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!


(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)


THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.


ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.


BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.


BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?


A WHORE He tore his coat.


BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.


BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...


BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.


BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...


BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!


BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!


FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?


BELLA Do you want me to call the police?


BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.


BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!


BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.


BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?


ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.


BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?


STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.


CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.


STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.


VOICES She's faithfultheman.


CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.


PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.


PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.


STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.


CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.


STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...


PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?


STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?


DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.


(He staggers a pace back.)


BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.


STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.


BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.


CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.


BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?


(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.


(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.


STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.


STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.

BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.

STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)

KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

PATRICE Socialiste!

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.

STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!

A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.


THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.


RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.

(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!


PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...

(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?

STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.

CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!

A ROUGH Our men retreated.

PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!

(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)

PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.

STEPHEN Did I? When?

BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.

THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!

(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.

PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)

CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!

CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.

BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!

STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.

PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!

STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.


VOICES Police!

DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.

THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Dooooooooooog!

THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Goooooooooood!

(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)

PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!

BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?

LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)

STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.

BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.

STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.

CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.

BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.

PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.

(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!

THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!

(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)

THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.

BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!

PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!

(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)

FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?

A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.

BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.

BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?

BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

FIRST WATCH Name and address.

(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.

(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.

SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.

BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.

SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)

BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...

(The horse neighs.)

THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)

CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!

THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.

BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)

CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.

BLOOM Night.

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!

STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!

(Murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)

BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!

RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10EmbedMISSING YOU Lyrics[지드래곤 "Missing You" 가사]

[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
아무 생각 없이 평소와 같이
보통 사람들과 만나 웃고 말하지
밤이 되면 TV가 내 유일한 친구고
아침해가 떠오르면은 그제서야 잠이 들죠
너무 초라해 나 널 많이 좋아했나봐
네가 떠난 후 파란 하늘 내 눈엔 노랗게만 보여
그댄 어디서 아파해요? 나 여기 있어
아님 혹시 다른 사람과 다른 사랑하니?
보고싶어, my baby
[Chorus: 김윤아]
내 맘은 이리 울적한데 말할 사람이 없다
나도 가끔 활짝 웃고 싶은데 곁엔 아무도 없다
Maybe I'm missing you, oh-oh
Maybe I'm missing you, oh-oh
Maybe I'm missing you, oh-oh
Maybe I'm missing you

[Verse 2: G-Dragon]
그땐 그랬지. 우리 사이는 투명하고 깨끗했지
처음에는 애틋했지. 다들 그래. 알면서 왜 그랬지?
(But) 갈수록 유리 깨지듯, 손에 낀 반지가 빛 바래지듯
날카로운 칼에 베이듯, 속박이란 사슬에 목이 죄이듯
늘 좋을 줄만 알았던 너와의 기억도
풀리지 않던 오해 및 상처만 남아 싫어도
헤어져란 말은 끝까지 참았어야만 했는데
(그래도) 싸우고 다투던 그때가 지금보단 나았을텐데

[Chorus: 김윤아]
내 맘은 이리 울적한데 말할 사람이 없다
나도 가끔 활짝 웃고 싶은데 곁엔 아무도 없다

With the needle and the stone   on the night tides.           a compass
For drede of the dark night   they dreched a little           slowed down
And all the steren of the streme   steken at ones.           And all the stern men of the stream (i.e., sailors) struck sail at once

The king was in a grete cogge   with knightes full many,           ship
In a cabane enclosed,   clenlich arrayed;           cabin; completely
Within on a rich bed   restes a little,
And with the swogh of the se   in swefning he fell.           swaying; dreaming
Him dremed of a dragon,   dredful to behold,           He dreamed
Come drivand over the deep   to drenchen his pople,           driving; drown
Even walkand   out the West landes,           Directly walking
Wanderand unworthyly   over the wale ythes;           Wandered unbecomingly; surging waves
Both his hed and his hals   were holly all over           neck; wholly
Ounded of azure,   enamelled full fair;           Covered with waves of azure, enamelled (coloured) very fair
His shoulders were shaled   all in clene silver           His shoulders were all covered with scales of pure silver
Shredde over all the shrimp   with shrinkand pointes;           That clothed the monster with shrinking points (like mail)
His womb and his winges   of wonderful hewes,           belly; hues
In marvelous mailes   he mounted full high.
Whom that he touched   he was tint forever!           lost
His feet were flourished   all in fine sable           decorated
And such a venomous flaire   flow from his lippes           flame flowed
The flood of the flawes   all on fire seemed!           outpouring; flames

Then come out of the Orient,   even him againes,           Then came out of the East, directly against him
A black bustous bere   aboven in the cloudes,           A wild black bear above in the clouds
With ech a paw as a post   and paumes full huge           With each paw as big as a post, and palms very huge
With pikes full perilous,   all pliand them seemed;           With very perilous claws that seemed all curling
Lothen and lothly,   lockes and other,           Hateful and loathly, his hair and the rest
All with lutterd legges,   lokkerd unfair,           With legs all bowed, covered with ugly hair
Filtered unfreely,   with fomand lippes -            That was churlishly matted, with foaming lips
The foulest of figure   that formed was ever!
He baltered, he blered,   he braundished thereafter;           danced about; grimaced
To batail he bounes him   with bustous clawes;           prepares himself; wild
He romed, he rored,   that rogged all the erthe,           bellowed; roared; rocked
So rudely he rapped at   to riot himselven!           So violently he stamped on (the earth) to enjoy himself

Then the dragon on dregh   dressed him againes           finally came against him
And with his duttes him drove   on dregh by the welken;           blows; afar; sky
He fares as a faucon,   frekly he strikes;           falcon; boldly
Both with feet and with fire   he fightes at ones.
The bere in the batail   the bigger him seemed,           bear
And bites him boldly   with baleful tuskes;
Such buffetes he him reches   with his brode klokes,           gives; claws
His breste and his brayell   was bloody all over.           breast; waist
He ramped so rudely   that all the erthe rives,           He reared up on his hind legs so rudely that all the earth was shaken
Runnand on red blood   as rain of the heven!           Running
He had weried the worm   by wightness of strenghe           wearied; serpent; stoutness
Ne were it not for the wild fire   that he him with defendes.           himself

Then wanders the worm   away to his heightes,           serpent
Comes glidand fro the cloudes   and coupes full even,           strikes directly
Touches him with his talones   and teres his rigge,           tears; back
Betwix the taile and the top   ten foot large!           long
Thus he brittened the bere   and brought him o live,           Thus he beat down the bear and killed him
Let him fall in the flood,   fleet where him likes.           float
So they thring the bold king   binne the ship-borde,           These dreams so oppress the king aboard the ship
That ner he bristes for bale   on bed where he ligges.           That he nearly bursts for pain on the bed where he lies

Then waknes the wise king,   wery fortravailed,           wakens; wearily exhausted
Takes him two philosophers   that followed him ever,
In the seven science   the sutelest founden,           most subtle
The cunningest of clergy   under Crist knowen;           most learned of scholars
He told them of his torment   that time that he sleeped:
"Dreched with a dragon   and such a derf beste,           Harassed; dire beast
Has made me full wery,   as wisse me Our Lord;           guide
Ere I mon swelt as swithe,   ye tell me my swefen!"           Before I must die quickly, interpret my dream for me

"Sir," said they soon then,   these sage philosophers,           immediately; wise
"The dragon that thou dremed of,   so dredful to shew,           dreamed; behold
That come drivand over the deep   to drenchen thy pople,           driving; drown
Soothly and certain   thyselven it is,
That thus sailes over the se   with thy seker knightes.           trusty
The coloures that were casten   upon his clere winges           shining
May be thy kingrikes all,   that thou has right wonnen,           kingdoms
And the tattered tail,   with tonges so huge,           tongues
Betokens this fair folk   that in thy fleet wendes.           Signifies
The bere that brittened was   aboven in the cloudes           beaten down
Betokenes the tyrauntes   that tormentes thy pople
Or elles with some giaunt   some journee shall happen,           else; day's fight
In singular batail   by yourselve one;           battle; alone
And thou shall have the victory,   through help of Our Lord,
As thou in thy vision   was openly shewed.
Of this dredful dreme   ne drede thee no more,           dream
Ne care not, sir conquerour,   but comfort thyselven
And these that sailes over the se   with thy seker knightes."

With trumpes then tristly   they trussen up their sailes           trumpet calls; boldly
And rowes over the rich se,   this rout all at ones;           company
The comly coste of Normandy   they catchen full even           coast; reach
And blithely at Barflete   these bold are arrived,           Barfleur
And findes a fleet there   of frendes ynow,
The flowr and the fair folk   of fifteen rewmes,           kingdoms
For kinges and capitaines   keeped him fair,           awaited
As he at Carlisle commaunded   at Cristenmass himselven.

By they had taken the land   and tentes up rered,           By the time; reared
Comes a Templar tite   and touched to the king;           quickly; told
"Here is a tyraunt beside   that tormentes thy pople,
A grete giaunt of Gene,   engendered of fendes;           Genoa; by fiends
He has freten of folk   mo than five hundreth,           devoured; more; hundred
And als fele fauntekins   of free-born childer.           And as many infants of noble children
This has been his sustenaunce   all this seven winteres,
And yet is that sot not sad,   so well him it likes!           rogue
In the countree of Constantine   no kind has he leved           family; left
Withouten kidd casteles,   enclosed with walles,
That he ne has clenly distroyed   all the knave childer,           male children
And them carried to the crag   and clenly devoured.
The duchess of Bretain   today has he taken,           Brittany
Beside Reines as sho rode   with her rich knightes,           Rennes; she
Led her to the mountain   there that lede lenges           man
To lie by that lady   ay whiles her life lastes.
We followed o ferrome   mo than five hundreth           from afar
Of bernes and of burges   and bachelers noble,           townsmen
But he covered the crag;   sho cried so loud           got to
The care of that creature   cover shall I never           recover
Sho was the flowr of all Fraunce   or of five rewmes,
And one of the fairest   that formed was ever,
The gentilest jowell   ajudged with lordes           most noble jewel; by
Fro Gene unto Gerone   by Jesu of heven!           Genoa; Gironne
Sho was thy wifes cosin,   know it if thee likes,           relative; acknowledge
Comen of the richest   that regnes in erthe;           reigns
As thou art rightwise king,   rew on thy pople           righteous; have pity
And fonde for to venge them   that thus are rebuked!"           endeavour; avenge

"Alas," says Sir Arthur,   "so long have I lived!
Had I witten of this,   well had me cheved.           known; achieved
Me is not fallen fair   but me is foul happened
That thus this fair lady   this fend has destroyed!           fiend
I had lever than all Fraunce   this fifteen winter           I would give the revenues of all France for the past fifteen years
I had been before that freke   a furlong of way           To have been even a furlong from that man
When he that lady had laght   and led to the mountes;           seized
I had left my life   ere sho had harm limped.           suffered
But wolde thou ken me to that crag   there that keen lenges,           show; keen one
I wolde kaire to that coste   and carp with himselven,
To trete with that tyraunt   for tresoun of landes           treat; treason
And take trews for a time   til it may tide better."           truce; betide

"Sir, see ye yon forland   with yon two fires?           promontary
There filsnes that fend,   fraist when thee likes,           lurks; try
Upon the crest of the crag   by a cold well
That encloses the cliff   with the clere strandes;           shining
There may thou find folk   fey withouten number,           dead
Mo florines, in faith,   than Fraunce is in after,           More coins
And more tresure untrewly   that traitour has getten           dishonestly; gotten
Than in Troy was, as I trow,   that time that it was wonnen."           believe

Then romes the rich king   for rewth of the pople,           bellows; pity
Raikes right to a tent   and restes no lenger;           Goes; longer
He welteres, he wresteles,   he wringes his handes;           writhes; wrestles
There was no wye of this world   that wiste what he mened.           knew; meant
He calles Sir Kayous   that of the cup served
And Sir Bedvere the bold   that bore his brand rich:           sword
"Look ye after even-song   be armed at rightes           completely
On blonkes by yon buscaile,   by yon blithe stremes,           horses; brush; calm
For I will pass in pilgrimage   privily hereafter,
In the time of souper,   when lordes are served,           dinner
For to seeken a saint   by yon salt stremes,
In Saint Michel mount,   there miracles are shewed."

After even-song   Sir Arthur himselven
Went to his wardrope   and warp off his weedes           wardrobe; threw; clothes
Armed him in a aketoun   with orfrayes full rich;           padded jacket; gold trim
Aboven, on that, a jerin   of Acres out over;           Upon that, a leather jacket
Aboven that a gesseraunt   of gentle mailes,           coat of mail
A jupon of Jerodine   jagged in shredes;           gipon; shreds
He braides on a bacenett   burnisht of silver           draws; helmet
The best that was in Basel,   with bordours rich;           borders
The crest and the coronal   enclosed so fair           diadem
With claspes of clere gold,   couched with stones;           shining; set
The vesar, the aventail, enarmed so fair,           visor; face-guard; plated
Void withouten vice,   with windowes of silver;           Devoid of defects
His gloves gaylich gilt   and graven at the hemmes           gaily; decorated
With graines and gobelets,   glorious of hew.           seed pearls; jewels
He braces a brode sheld   and his brand askes,           He puts on the arm straps (braces) of a broad shield and asks for his sword
Bouned him a brown steed   and on the bente hoves;           Went to; ground waits
He stert til his stirrup   and strides on loft,           leapt; aloft
Straines him stoutly   and stirres him fair,
Broches the bay steed   and to the busk rides,           Spurs; bush
And there his knightes him keeped   full clenlich arrayed.           waited

Then they rode by that river   that runned so swithe,           swiftly
There the rindes over-reches   with real boughes;           trees reach over; stately
The roe and the reindeer   reckless there runnen,           roe deer
In ranes and in rosers   to riot themselven;           bushes; rosebushes; amuse
The frithes were flourisht   with flowres full many,           woods; flowered
With faucons and fesauntes   of ferlich hewes;           falcons; pheasants; wondrous
All the fowles there flashes   that flies with winges,
For there galed the gouk   on greves full loud;           sang; cuckoo; groves
With alkine gladship   they gladden themselven;           all sorts of gladness
Of the nightingale notes   the noises was sweet;
They threped with the throstels   three hundreth at ones!           debated; thrushes
That whate swowing of water   and singing of birds,           swift sound
It might salve him of sore   that sound was never!

Then ferkes this folk   and on foot lightes,           goes
Fastenes their fair steedes   o ferrom between;           They tie their horses with a good distance between them
And then the king keenly   commaunded his knightes
For to bide with their blonkes   and boun no further;           horses; go
"For I will seek this saint   by myselve one
And mele with this master man   that this mount yemes,           speak; possesses
And senn shall ye offer,   either after other           And afterwards you shall make your offerings, each after the other
Menskfully at Saint Michel,   full mighty with Crist."           Honourably to

The king covers the crag   with cloughes full high,           gets to; ravines
To the crest of the cliff   he climbes on loft,
Cast up his umbrere   and keenly he lookes,           visor
Caught of the cold wind   to comfort himselven.
Two fires he findes   flamand full high;
The fourtedele a furlong   between them he walkes;           quarter to
The way by the well-strandes   he wanderd him one           welling water
To wite of the warlaw,   where that he lenges.           learn; warlock; dwells
He ferkes to the first fire   and even there he findes           goes
A wery woful widow   wringand her handes,
And gretand on a grave   grisly teres,           weeping
New merked on molde,   senn mid-day it seemed.           Newly dug in the earth
He salued that sorrowful   with sittand wordes           saluted; fitting
And fraines after the fend   fairly thereafter.           asks; fiend

Then this woful wife   unwinly him greetes,           woman unhappily
Coverd up on her knees   and clapped her handes,
Said: "Careful, careman,   thou carpes too loud!           man
May yon warlaw wite,   he warrays us all!           warlock know; attacks
Weryd worth the wight ay   that thee thy wit reved,           Cursed be; man; stole

I warn thee, for worship,   thou wilnes after sorrow!           desire
Whider buskes thou, berne?   unblessed thou seemes!           Whither go
Weenes thou to britten him   with thy brand rich?           Expect; destroy; sword
Were thou wighter than Wade   or Wawain   either,           fiercer
Thou winnes no worship,   I warn thee before.
Thou sained thee unsekerly   to seek to these mountes;           You crossed yourself unsafely (started out wrong) to go to these mountains
Such six were too simple   to semble with him one,           Six such as you would be too weak to attack him alone
For, and thou see him with sight,   thee serves no herte           For, if you see him with your eyes, you will not have the heart
To saine thee sekerly,   so seemes him huge.           To cross yourself securely, so huge does he seem
Thou art freely and fair   and in thy first flowres,           noble
But thou art fey, by my faith,   and that me forthinkes!           fated to die; grieves

Of all the frendes sho had   there followed none after
But I, her foster moder,   of fifteen winter.           mother

Stands the form burnt out of clay.
This must be the bell’s great birth!
Fellows, lend a hand to-day.
Sweat must trickle now
From the burning brow,
Till the work its master honour.
Blessing comes from Heaven’s Donor.
While we our serious work are doing,
We ought to speak a serious word,
More easily our work pursuing,
When noble speech the while is heard.
Now let us earnestly be spying
What our weak powers can create;
I scorn the man who is not trying
On his own work to meditate.
This is the fairest of man’s graces:
The power to think and understand—
For in his inmost heart he traces
What he has fashioned with his hand.
Wood that from the pine-tree came
Keep right dry with zealous care,
That the deftly governed flame
Through the furnace hole may flare.
Boiling copper’s thick—
Get the tin now, quick!
Let the substance, liquid growing,
In a docile way be flowing.
What with the help of fire’s great power.
In this deep pit our hands have framed,
High on the belfry of the tower
In mighty tones shall be proclaimed.
In ages far beyond the morrow,
A voice for many shall ring out,
And it will mourn with those in sorrow
And join the choir of the devout.
What fate, forever changing, fleeting,
To mortals far below may bring,
Against the crown of metal beating,
As music of the bell will ring.
Bubbles leaping, white and spry!
Good! The masses flow at last.
Mix them with the alkali,
That they be more quickly cast.
From all foam quite free
Shall the mixture be,
From the metal pure before us,
Rise a perfect voice sonorous.
The bell with festive peal and cheering
Greets the belovèd tender child,
Upon his life’s first way appearing,
Still in the arms of sleep beguiled.
Deep in the womb of time there stay
His destinies, both dark and gay.
His mother’s gentle, loving care
Is watching still his morning fair.
The years fly swiftly—all is play.
Away from girls, impatient, tearing,
The boy starts wildly forth to roam,
He sees the world, and, after faring,
Comes back, a stranger, to his home.
In beauty and youth’s splendour glowing,
A vision from some heavenly height,
While blushes on her cheeks are growing,
He sees the maiden with delight.
And now a strange and nameless yearning
Has seized upon the young man’s heart,
From sports and wild companions turning,
With tearful eyes he roams apart.
And happy at her slightest speaking,
Her footsteps blushingly to trace,
He wanders over meadows, seeking
The fairest flowers his love to grace.
Oh, tender longing, sweetest hoping,
First love’s enchanting, golden days!
The eye can see the heavens oping,
A bliss the heart unhindered sways.
Would it might bloom eternally—
The time of young love’s ecstasy!
See, how brown the blow-pipes grow!
When this stick has been dipped in,
And a glaze begins to show,
Then the casting should begin.
Now good fellows, quick!
Prove the mixture thick!
Hard and soft united duly
Are a lucky omen truly.
For when the stern and mild are pairing,
The tender with the strong and daring,
The tone must ring out fair and strong.
Let him who binds himself forever,
To sound his heart and hers endeavour!
Passion is short, repentance long.
On the young bride’s tresses lightly
Lies the wreath of blossoms white,
When the church bells, ringing brightly,
To the festive hour invite.
Lovely festival—the ending
Of—alas!—life’s joyous May,
Beautiful illusions rending
With the veil and bride’s array!
Passion will fly!
Love must remain;
The flower must die,
The fruit to attain.
The man must go out
To stern hostile life,
For power and strife,
To plant and to toil,
To gain and to foil,
To wager and dare,
His luck to ensnare.
And now without end the blessings are streaming,
With goodly possessions the storerooms are teeming,
The rooms are expanding, the house has to grow.
And in it there moves
The good, modest housewife,
The mother of children,
Who wise and dear
Here rules in her sphere,
And teaches the girls
And wards off the boys,
While work without end
Her busy hands tend,
Enlarging her share
Through order and care,
Her sweet-smelling linen-chests filling with treasure,
By spinning her thread in the speediest measure.
Her neatly and smoothly kept closets are full
Of linen like snow and the shining fair wool;
And still adding glamour and charm to the best,
She never can rest.
And the father with happy eye
From his mansion’s high gable is counting
Blessings fair that before him lie—
Pillars and posts as high as the trees,
Barns that are bursting with treasures that please,
Granges with bounties swelling and bending,
Grain-fields waving in billows unending.
He boasts with noble pride:
Firm as the ground abide
My homestead’s splendours bright
Against misfortune’s might!
Covenants with powers of fate
Will—alack!—not always last,
And misfortune travels fast.
Now the casting can begin,
For the dented mould is fair:
But before we pour it in,
Let us say a pious prayer!
Push the tendon hard!
God shall be our guard!
In the bell's ear smoking, glowing,
Waves of fiery brown are flowing.
Most wholesome is the force of fire,
When man can tame and guard its ire,
And from this heavenly force man takes
Good help for what he moulds and makes.
But frightful is this power's abuse
When, from its fetters broken loose,
Upon its own track wantonly
It roams as nature's daughter free.
Horror when unbound and growing
—Fiend that no resistance stays!—
Through the peopled city blowing
Sweeps along the monster-blaze!
Elements have ever hated
What the hand of man created.
From the cloud
Rain is pouring,
Earth restoring.
From the cloud, even so,
Lightnings glow!
From the tower hear the wail:
’Tis the gale!
Bloody red
Are the heavens;
Daylight ne’er such brightness shed!
Riot leavens
All the crowds!
Dense smoke-clouds!
Fiery pillar, flickering, glowing,
Down the street is swiftly going,
Like the wind so rapid growing.
Hot, as if in furnace baking,
Glows the air; the beams are breaking,
Windows rattle, posts are falling,
Mothers straying, children calling,
Beasts are moaning,
Crushed, and groaning.
All run, save and flee in fright,
Bright as daylight is the night,
Chains of eager hands are plying,
Pails are flying,
Arching water-spouts are playing,
Flames with hissing fountains spraying;
Howling wild the storm is straying,
Driving on the flame with roars.
Crackling in the dry grain-stores
Shoots the flame, through garrets sweeping,
Fast along the rafters creeping,
And, as if with monstrous blowing
It would sweep along in flight
The whole earth with all its might,
Rises, now gigantic growing,
To the sky.
Man stands by:
Hopeless, awestruck, he is yielding,
Sees the heavens their power wielding,
His own works to ruin going.
Now the homestead
Is burnt bare;
Savage storms are raging there.
Empty window-holes are staring
Horror-haunted,
And the sailing clouds undaunted
Peer inside.
Man—alack!—
Glances back
At the grave
Of the goods he could not save:
Then ventures forth with spirit brave.
However sadly he has fared,
Though raging fire has so bereft him,
The sweetest comfort still is left him:
He counts his dear ones: all are spared.
Now ’tis resting in the earth,
For the form contains its fill.
Will there be a happy birth,
To repay our care and skill?
Is there a mistake?
If the form should break?
While our hopes are soaring high—
Woe!—misfortune may be nigh.
Unto the sacred earth confiding,
We trust to her our hands’ own deed,
The sower trusts to her his seed,
Calm, with a blessèd hope abiding
That it shall grow as Heaven decreed.
Alas, we know that seed far rarer
In earth’s dark bosom buried lies,
And hope that to a lot still fairer
Out of the graveyard it will rise.
From the church
Tolls the bell
Grave and heavy
Funeral knell.
And the toll sonorous is attending
One more pilgrim on his last way wending.
Woe! It is the wife belovèd.
Woe! It is the faithful mother
Whom the shadow prince of harm
Drew from out her husband’s arm,
From her tender children’s sphere,
Whom she bare him, fair and dear,
And then watched with mother’s zest
As they grew upon her breast.
Ah! The home’s most tender ties
Are unloosed forevermore;
In the shadowland she lies
Who was mother here before.
How they miss her faithful guiding,
And the care she used to give!
In the orphaned home presiding,
Loveless strangers soon will live.
Till the bell shall cooler be,
After labour take your ease,
And as birds play in the tree,
Each shall do what he may please.
Youth, at rise of stars,
Free from duty’s bars,
Hears the evening bell, releasing:
Master’s toil is never ceasing.
In the forest wild the wanderer
Homeward turns his steps with pleasure
To his dear and cheerful cottage.
Homeward trudge the sheep-flocks bleating,
And the herds
Of the sleek and broad-browed cattle
With their lowing
To accustomed stalls are going.
Now with grain
Heavy laden,
Reels the wagon:
And beneath
Sheaves, the wreath
Fragrant lies;
To the dance the flock of reapers
Gaily flies.
Streets and markets grow more quiet;
Round the bright and genial lamplight
All the household members gather,
And the town-gate closes, creaking.
Blackness spreads
O’er the earth;
But the steady townsman dreads
Not the night
Rousing wicked men from bed:
For the eye of law is ever bright.
Sacred order, blessings spreading,
Heaven’s daughter, freely treading,
Like to like thou bindest lightly,
Cities thou hast founded rightly,
And the wild man roaming blindly
Thou hast called to home-life, kindly.
To men’s homes thy presence giving,
Thou hast taught them gentle living,
Woven of all ties the deepest—
Love for fatherland thou keepest!
Busy hands, by thousands stirring,
Briskly one another aid,
And, while eager work is spurring,
All the powers are displayed.
Under freedom’s wing united,
Master and apprentice toil,
Each with his own place delighted,
Ready any scorn to foil.
Work adorns the burgher greatly,
Blessing is our labour’s prize;
Honoured crowns make princes stately,
But in work our honour lies.
Blessed peace, oh
Sweetest concord,
Tarry, tarry
With your kindness in this town!
May that day be never dawning,
When the hordes of war with terror
Raid across this quiet valley,
When the heavens
Which the lovely glow of evening
Gently paints,
Flash, alas, when towns are burning,
Fiery taints!
Break the form now, stand me by,
For its purpose is fulfilled;
And rejoice, let heart and eye
By the well-done task be thrilled.
Swing the hammer, whack!
Till the cope shall crack!
For the finished bell shall rise,
When the form in pieces lies.
In time the master, skilled and knowing,
Can break the form most prudently.
Woe! When in fiery torrents flowing,
The ore itself seeks liberty!
In blindest rage with thundrous roaring,
The bursting house it rushes through,
As if the jaws of hell were pouring
The flames that death and horror spew.
Where raw wild forces rage and blight,
Men can create no form aright;
And no true welfare can there be,
When mobs are by themselves set free.
Woe, when the tinder-heap is swelling
In hearts of cities, in the night,	        355
The masses tear their chains, rebelling,
And free themselves with fury’s might!
Then riot, to the bell-ropes clinging,
Pulls till the bell begins to howl;
Devoted once to peaceful ringing,
She gives the sign for outrage foul.
Equality and freedom! screaming,
The burgher in once peaceful hands
Grasps weapons; streets and halls are teeming,
And everywhere swarm ruffian bands.
With jest and ribaldry unsparing,
The women like hyenas grow,
With panther’s fangs unbridled tearing
The flinching bosom of the foe.
There is no sacredness remaining,
Unloosed are ties of piety,
The bad in goodness’ place is reigning,
And every vice is swaying free.
A lion wakened is ferocious,
Destructive is the tiger’s bite;
But of all horrors most atrocious
Is man at his own madness’ height.
Woe unto those who to the yearning,
The ever-blind lend heaven’s torch!
It will not beam; to ashes burning,
The fields and cities it will scorch.
Gladness God has given me!
Now the kernel shells the mould,
Rising smoothly, evenly,
Shining like a star of gold.
Dome and crest both beam,
Like the sunlight’s gleam,
And the blazon’s quaint device
Shows performance skilled and nice.
Come in and see!
Now, fellows, let us close the ring,
For the bell’s high christening:
Concordia her name shall be.
For concord, deepest brotherhood with all,
The loving congregation she shall call.
This be the calling of the bell,
Wherefore she has been fashioned well!
With earthly life beneath her lying,
High she shall swing in heaven’s blue dome,
A neighbour of the thunder, flying
And touching on the starry home,
Her voice from heights celestial raising,
Like all the stars in heaven’s sphere,
That live and move, their Maker praising,
And leading forth the festive year.
Our bell, her metal voice devoting
Alone to grave, eternal things,
Shall ever feel, while she is floating,
The throbbing touch of time’s swift wings.
The tongue of fate, she shall be ringing:
Heartless herself and pitiless,
She shall accompany with swinging
Life’s game of constant changefulness.
And as her mighty peal sonorous
Within our ears at last shall die,
A lesson she will put before us,
That all things earthly must go by.
Come now, with the ropes’ whole might,
From her dungeon swing the bell,
Till she rise to heaven’s height,
In the realm of sound to dwell!
Pull and lift—still more!
See her move and soar!
Joy unto this city bringing,
Peace shall be her first glad ringing!EmbedTranslationsEnglishRomanization크레용 (CRAYON) Lyrics[지드래곤 "크레용" 가사]

I was born in Tokyo, raised in Hip Hop
My friends were usually those thugs
I ended up being like those thugs
I walked the back alleys of this city
Shibuya, Roppongi, yeah, my adolescence
Passed by quickly, I was deep in it
I left my backpack at high school
And caused my parents so much trouble
But time has passed, now I’m on magazine covers
The Don Dada’s influence is everywhere
When I grab the mic, I’m really No. 1
Top ranker, representing Tokyo
Yeah, this land and country give me life
And JAH1 hands me this invincible mic

This land that we tread on like this now
Always opening up a new page

Those that understand are singing with me
We’ll say how it is without hiding anything
A reflection throwing off all pressure
Emotions pour forth and spill over
It’s a love that’ll never go out
I’ll enter the battlefield and not back away
The lily’s crest will bloom and never wither
A wind blows on this early afternoon
A rainbow sticks out after the rain like this
The puddles reflect the light of the sun

Thank you for always liking us so much, you've had many hard times, and you've worked hard by taking our side. At each of those moments, I'm very thankful and I love you. I feel so good because I always have ARMYs. The "ARMY Effect" is probably the biggest factor in maintaining my optimistic personality. Everyone, have a happy new year and always be happy. ❤Suga

In this album that we are releasing at the start of
the New Year, I want to ask that you take care of
us this year as well.

First, my family. I miss you and want to take care
of you from beside you, but I'm sorry that I can't do
that. My family who I love, please don’t ever forget
that I love you. Thank you, always.

Our members, Namjoonie hyung. Seokjinie hyung,
Hoseokie hyung, Yoongi hyung, Taehyungie, Jeonggukie. Thinking about it, we’re already about
to enter our 5th year (since debut). I always feel this, but I think I can be strong just from looking at
you guys who are always beside me. We used to not match/mix well, but now I often think that we’re like real brothers. I want to express my gratitude to all of you who make all the work that I do feel more enjoyable. I love you.

The hyungnims who I treasure and love: Timo hyung, Sungwoon hyung, Taeminie hyung,
Kwonho hyung, Jonginie hyung. Since I see you
as often as I see my members, it might be
embarrassing to see words like this written here,
but everyday is fun because of you hyungs. Now
let the maknae buy a meal. I love you.

A.R.M.Y.

We're already approaching the start of our 5th
year (since debut). Time goes by so~ fast, doesn’t
it. I also wonder when time flew by so quickly.

Don’t worry. There’s still so much we have to show
you, so starting with this album, I think we’ll spend this year together. Let's start this album and spend
this year pleasantly. Have a happy new year. don’t
get sick, and I hope everyone can be happy. I love
you!

I love all of you who are always with us.
Sincerely, Jimin.V

Now I will write a whole letter for all the people I love
and am thankful for in my Thanks To. I’m not

Taehyung. It might’ve been hard to watch me from
afar in a situation that couldn’t be helped after having always had me by your side, but always my family. Please watch and look after our grandfather whom we love. The fact that I can't send grandmother away is still hard for me, but I’m also making an effort. I’II hold it in and work diligently to become my grandmother's grandson, a pretty grandson, so please watch over me. Have a happy new year (receive lots of fortune) and thank you for raising me all this time. I love you.

화면에 나오는 내 모습이

English

Even if I lose everything, if my popularity drops
Even if I can't sing, if I get a different job
Will you still be able to love me for who I am?

Do you know that who I am on screen isn't really my everything? (Do you know?)
Do you know that my overflowing confidence makes me even more anxious? (Do you know?)
Standing under the flashing lights, there is a thick shadow behind me

Even if I lose everything, if my popularity drops
Even if I can't sing, if I get a different job
Will you still be able to love me for who I am?

You say that you love me but
Am I really who you love? (Am I?)
You say that you fell for me but
Am I really the one who made you fall for me? (Am I?)
When you are in my arms, looking at me
I want to ask you these questions

Even if I lose everything, if my popularity drops
Even if I can't sing, if I get a different job
Will you still be able to love me for who I am?

Someday, the day will come (the day will come)
I'll come down from the stage where the cheers have decreased
As my shoulders droop down (shoulders droop down)
My head hung low (even then)
Will you stand by my side?

[Intro: Lee Hi]
봄이 와, 꽃을 피우고
여름이 와, 기억이 녹아 내려도

[Verse 1: Tablo]
난 원래 사계절이 어울리지 않아
차가운 아이잖아
모진 성격은 살을 에는 겨울
시린 바람, 알만큼 알잖아
내겐 냉정이 다인 걸
겨울바다 같은 심장인 걸
배를 띄워 다가오면 알겠지
내가 섬이 아닌 빙산인 걸
[Verse 2: Mithra Jin]
난 초점을 잃었지
서리 낀 눈 시린 기억이
밟혀서 목젖 없이 비명만 질렀지
아픈 상처만 남은 빙판이었지
눈사태 난 듯 무너진 맘
추스려 보니 다시 불 꺼진 밤
너란 해가 떠도 눈 덮인 산은 녹지 않아

[Chorus: Lee Hi, Tablo, Lee Hi & Mithra Jin]
여긴 춥다 (주머니에 손을 숨겨봐도)
너무 춥다 (손을 모아 입김 불어봐도)
마음이 얼어붙어서 (It's so cold)
자꾸 입술이 튼다
나만 춥다 (이불로 내 몸을 감싸봐도)
너무 춥다 (누군가의 품에 안겨봐도)
가슴이 구멍 나서 (It's so cold)
막아보려 해도 자꾸 바람이 샌다

[Verse 3: Mithra Jin]
봄은 설레며 찾아오지만
난 가을의 끝자락에 서
겨울에 멈춘 기억
따스함은 가뒀어
마른 마음의 튼 살 안에서
얼어붙은 강물에 갇힌 추억
붙잡고 내 손을 놓지 않아
차가웠던 이별을 안 뒤부터
꽃 피던 그 봄은 오지 않아

[OLGA, in the regulation blue dress of a teacher at a girl's high school, is walking about correcting exercise books; MASHA, in a black dress, with a hat on her knees, sits and reads a book; IRINA, in white, stands about, with a thoughtful expression.]

OLGA.
It's just a year since father died last May the fifth, on your name-day, Irina. It was very cold then, and snowing. I thought I would never survive it, and you were in a dead faint. And now a year has gone by and we are already thinking about it without pain, and you are wearing a white dress and your face is happy. [Clock strikes twelve] And the clock struck just the same way then. [Pause] I remember that there was music at the funeral, and they fired a volley in the cemetery. He was a general in command of a brigade but there were few people present. Of course, it was raining then, raining hard, and snowing.

IRINA.
Why think about it!

[BARON
TUZENBACH, CHEBUTIKIN and SOLENI appear by the table in the dining-room, behind the pillars.]
OLGA.
It's so warm to-day that we can keep the windows open, though the birches are not yet in flower. Father was put in command of a brigade, and he rode out of Moscow with us eleven years ago. I remember perfectly that it was early in May and that everything in Moscow was flowering then. It was warm too, everything was bathed in sunshine. Eleven years have gone, and I remember everything as if we rode out only yesterday. Oh, God! When I awoke this morning and saw all the light and the spring, joy entered my heart, and I longed passionately to go home.

CHEBUTIKIN.
Will you take a bet on it?

TUZENBACH.
Oh, nonsense.

[MASHA,
lost in a reverie over her book, whistles softly.]

OLGA.
Don't whistle, Masha. How can you! [Pause] I'm always having headaches from having to go to the High School every day and then teach till evening. Strange thoughts come to me, as if I were already an old woman. And really, during these four years that I have been working here, I have been feeling as if every day my strength and youth have been squeezed out of me, drop by drop. And only one desire grows and gains in strength...

IRINA.
To go away to Moscow. To sell the house, drop everything here, and go to Moscow...

OLGA.
Yes! To Moscow, and as soon as possible.

[CHEBUTIKIN and TUZENBACH laugh.]

IRINA.
I expect Andrey will become a professor, but still, he won't want to live here. Only poor Masha must go on living here.
OLGA.
Masha can come to Moscow every year, for the whole summer.

[MASHA is whistling gently.]

IRINA.
Everything will be arranged, please God. [Looks out of the window] It's nice out to-day. I don't know why I'm so happy: I remembered this morning that it was my name-day, and I suddenly felt glad and remembered my childhood, when mother was still with us. What beautiful thoughts I had, what thoughts!

OLGA.
You're all radiance to-day, I've never seen you look so lovely. And Masha is pretty, too. Andrey wouldn't be bad-looking, if he wasn't so stout; it does spoil his appearance. But I've grown old and very thin, I suppose it's because I get angry with the girls at school. To-day I'm free. I'm at home. I haven't got a headache, and I feel younger than I was yesterday. I'm only twenty-eight.... All's well, God is everywhere, but it seems to me that if only I were married and could stay at home all day, it would be even better. [Pause] I should love my husband.

TUZENBACH.
[To SOLENI] I'm tired of listening to the rot you talk. [Entering the sitting-room] I forgot to say that Vershinin, our new lieutenant-colonel of artillery, is coming to see us to-day. [Sits down to the piano.]

OLGA.
That's good. I'm glad.

IRINA.
Is he old?

TUZENBACH.
Oh, no. Forty or forty-five, at the very outside. [Plays softly] He seems rather a good sort. He's certainly no fool, only he likes to hear himself speak.

IRINA.
Is he interesting?
TUZENBACH.
Oh, he's all right, but there's his wife, his mother-in-law, and two daughters. This is his second wife. He pays calls and tells everybody that he's got a wife and two daughters. He'll tell you so here. The wife isn't all there, she does her hair like a flapper and gushes extremely. She talks philosophy and tries to commit suicide every now and again, apparently in order to annoy her husband. I should have left her long ago, but he bears up patiently, and just grumbles.

SOLENI.
[Enters with CHEBUTIKIN from the dining-room] With one hand I can only lift fifty-four pounds, but with both hands I can lift 180, or even 200 pounds. From this I conclude that two men are not twice as strong as one, but three times, perhaps even more....

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Reads a newspaper as he walks] If your hair is coming out... take an ounce of naphthaline and hail a bottle of spirit... dissolve and use daily.... [Makes a note in his pocket diary] When found make a note of! Not that I want it though.... [Crosses it out] It doesn't matter.

IRINA.
Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch!

CHEBUTIKIN.
What does my own little girl want?

IRINA.
Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch! I feel as if I were sailing under the broad blue sky with great white birds around me. Why is that? Why?

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Kisses her hands, tenderly] My white bird....

IRINA.
When I woke up to-day and got up and dressed myself, I suddenly began to feel as if everything in this life was open to me, and that I knew how I must live. Dear Ivan Romanovitch, I know everything. A man must work, toil in the sweat of his brow, whoever he may be, for that is the meaning and object of his life, his happiness, his enthusiasm. How fine it is to be a workman who gets up at daybreak and breaks stones in the street, or a shepherd, or a schoolmaster, who teaches children, or an engine-driver on the railway.... My God, let alone a man, it's better to be an ox, or just a horse, so long as it can work, than a young woman who wakes up at twelve o'clock, has her coffee in bed, and then spends two hours dressing.... Oh it's awful! Sometimes when it's hot, your thirst can be just as tiresome as my need for work. And if I don't get up early in future and work, Ivan Romanovitch, then you may refuse me your friendship.

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Tenderly] I'll refuse, I'll refuse....

OLGA.
Father used to make us get up at seven. Now Irina wakes at seven and lies and meditates about something till nine at least. And she looks so serious! [Laughs.]

IRINA.
You're so used to seeing me as a little girl that it seems queer to you when my face is serious. I'm twenty!

TUZENBACH.
How well I can understand that craving for work, oh God! I've never worked once in my life. I was born in Petersburg, a chilly, lazy place, in a family which never knew what work or worry meant. I remember that when I used to come home from my regiment, a footman used to have to pull off my boots while I fidgeted and my mother looked on in adoration and wondered why other people didn't see me in the same light. They shielded me from work; but only just in time! A new age is dawning, the people are marching on us all, a powerful, health-giving storm is gathering, it is drawing near, soon it will be upon us and it will drive away laziness, indifference, the prejudice against labour, and rotten dullness from our society. I shall work, and in twenty-five or thirty years, every man will have to work. Every one!

CHEBUTIKIN.
I shan't work.

TUZENBACH.
You don't matter.

SOLENI.
In twenty-five years' time, we shall all be dead, thank the Lord. In two or three years' time apoplexy will carry you off, or else I'll blow your brains out, my pet. [Takes a scent-bottle out of his pocket and sprinkles his chest and hands.]

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Laughs] It's quite true, I never have worked. After I came down from the university I never stirred a finger or opened a book, I just read the papers.... [Takes another newspaper out of his pocket] Here we are.... I've learnt from the papers that there used to be one, Dobrolubov [Note: Dobroluboy (1836-81), in spite of the shortness of his career, established himself as one of the classic literary critics of Russia], for instance, but what he wrote—I don't know... God only knows.... [Somebody is heard tapping on the floor from below] There.... They're calling me downstairs, somebody's come to see me. I'll be back in a minute... won't be long.... [Exit hurriedly, scratching his beard.]

IRINA.
He's up to something.

TUZENBACH.
Yes, he looked so pleased as he went out that I'm pretty certain he'll bring you a present in a moment.

IRINA.
How unpleasant!

OLGA.
Yes, it's awful. He's always doing silly things.

MASHA.

           &nbsp        "There stands a green oak by the sea.
           &nbsp       And a chain of bright gold is around it...
           &nbsp        And a chain of bright gold is around it...."
[Gets up and sings softly.]

OLGA.
You're not very bright to-day, Masha. [MASHA sings, putting on her hat] Where are you off to?

MASHA.
Home.

IRINA.
That's odd....

TUZENBACH.
On a name-day, too!

MASHA.
It doesn't matter. I'll come in the evening. Good-bye, dear. [Kisses MASHA] Many happy returns, though I've said it before. In the old days when father was alive, every time we had a name-day, thirty or forty officers used to come, and there was lots of noise and fun, and to-day there's only a man and a half, and it's as quiet as a desert... I'm off... I've got the hump to-day, and am not at all cheerful, so don't you mind me. [Laughs through her tears] We'll have a talk later on, but good-bye for the present, my dear; I'll go somewhere.

IRINA.
[Displeased] You are queer....

OLGA.
[Crying] I understand you, Masha.

SOLENI.
When a man talks philosophy, well, it is philosophy or at any rate sophistry; but when a woman, or two women, talk philosophy—it's all my eye.

MASHA.
What do you mean by that, you very awful man?

SOLENI.
Oh, nothing. You came down on me before I could say... help! [Pause.]

MASHA.
[Angrily, to OLGA] Don't cry!

[Enter ANFISA and FERAPONT with a cake.]

ANFISA.
This way, my dear. Come in, your feet are clean. [To IRINA] From the District Council, from Mihail Ivanitch Protopopov... a cake.

IRINA.
Thank you. Please thank him. [Takes the cake.]

FERAPONT.
What?

IRINA.
[Louder] Please thank him.

OLGA.
Give him a pie, nurse. Ferapont, go, she'll give you a pie.

FERAPONT.
What?

ANFISA.
Come on, gran'fer, Ferapont Spiridonitch. Come on. [Exeunt.]

MASHA.
I don't like this Mihail Potapitch or Ivanitch, Protopopov. We oughtn't to invite him here.

IRINA.
I never asked him.

MASHA.
That's all right.

[Enter CHEBUTIKIN followed by a soldier with a silver samovar; there is a rumble of dissatisfied surprise.]

OLGA.
[Covers her face with her hands] A samovar! That's awful! [Exit into the dining-room, to the table.]

IRINA.
My dear Ivan Romanovitch, what are you doing!

TUZENBACH.
[Laughs] I told you so!

MASHA.
Ivan Romanovitch, you are simply shameless!

CHEBUTIKIN.
My dear good girl, you are the only thing, and the dearest thing I have in the world. I'll soon be sixty. I'm an old man, a lonely worthless old man. The only good thing in me is my love for you, and if it hadn't been for that, I would have been dead long ago.... [To IRINA] My dear little girl, I've known you since the day of your birth, I've carried you in my arms... I loved your dead mother....

MASHA.
But your presents are so expensive!

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Angrily, through his tears] Expensive presents.... You really, are!... [To the orderly] Take the samovar in there.... [Teasing] Expensive presents!

[The orderly goes into the dining-room with the samovar.]

ANFISA.
[Enters and crosses stage] My dear, there's a strange Colonel come! He's taken off his coat already. Children, he's coming here. Irina darling, you'll be a nice and polite little girl, won't you.... Should have lunched a long time ago.... Oh, Lord.... [Exit.]

TUZENBACH.
It must be Vershinin. [Enter VERSHININ] Lieutenant-Colonel Vershinin!

VERSHININ.
[To MASHA and IRINA] I have the honour to introduce myself, my name is Vershinin. I am very glad indeed to be able to come at last. How you've grown! Oh! oh!

IRINA.
Please sit down. We're very glad you've come.

VERSHININ.
[Gaily] I am glad, very glad! But there are three sisters, surely. I remember—three little girls. I forget your faces, but your father, Colonel Prosorov, used to have three little girls, I remember that perfectly, I saw them with my own eyes. How time does fly! Oh, dear, how it flies!

TUZENBACH.
Alexander Ignateyevitch comes from Moscow.

IRINA.
From Moscow? Are you from Moscow?

VERSHININ.
Yes, that's so. Your father used to be in charge of a battery there, and I was an officer in the same brigade. [To MASHA] I seem to remember your face a little.

MASHA.
I don't remember you.

IRINA.
Olga! Olga! [Shouts into the dining-room] Olga! Come along! [OLGA enters from the dining-room] Lieutenant Colonel Vershinin comes from Moscow, as it happens.

VERSHININ.
I take it that you are Olga Sergeyevna, the eldest, and that you are Maria... and you are Irina, the youngest....

OLGA.
So you come from Moscow?

VERSHININ.
Yes. I went to school in Moscow and began my service there; I was there for a long time until at last I got my battery and moved over here, as you see. I don't really remember you, I only remember that there used to be three sisters. I remember your father well; I have only to shut my eyes to see him as he was. I used to come to your house in Moscow....

OLGA.
I used to think I remembered everybody, but...

VERSHININ.
My name is Alexander Ignateyevitch.

IRINA.
Alexander Ignateyevitch, you've come from Moscow. That is really quite a surprise!

OLGA.
We are going to live there, you see.

IRINA.
We think we may be there this autumn. It's our native town, we were born there. In Old Basmanni Road.... [They both laugh for joy.]

MASHA.
We've unexpectedly met a fellow countryman. [Briskly] I remember: Do you remember, Olga, they used to speak at home of a "lovelorn Major." You were only a Lieutenant then, and in love with somebody, but for some reason they always called you a Major for fun.

VERSHININ.
[Laughs] That's it... the lovelorn Major, that's got it!

MASHA.
You only wore moustaches then. You have grown older! [Through her tears] You have grown older!

VERSHININ.
Yes, when they used to call me the lovelorn Major, I was young and in love. I've grown out of both now.

OLGA.
But you haven't a single white hair yet. You're older, but you're not yet old.

VERSHININ.
I'm forty-two, anyway. Have you been away from Moscow long?

IRINA.
Eleven years. What are you crying for, Masha, you little fool.... [Crying] And I'm crying too.

MASHA.
It's all right. And where did you live?

VERSHININ.
Old Basmanni Road.

OLGA.
Same as we.

VERSHININ.
Once I used to live in German Street. That was when the Red Barracks were my headquarters. There's an ugly bridge in between, where the water rushes underneath. One gets melancholy when one is alone there. [Pause] Here the river is so wide and fine! It's a splendid river!

OLGA.
Yes, but it's so cold. It's very cold here, and the midges....

VERSHININ.
What are you saying! Here you've got such a fine healthy Russian climate. You've a forest, a river... and birches. Dear, modest birches, I like them more than any other tree. It's good to live here. Only it's odd that the railway station should be thirteen miles away.... Nobody knows why.

SOLENI.
I know why. [All look at him] Because if it was near it wouldn't be far off, and if it's far off, it can't be near. [An awkward pause.]

TUZENBACH.
Funny man.

OLGA.
Now I know who you are. I remember.

VERSHININ.
I used to know your mother.

CHEBUTIKIN.
She was a good woman, rest her soul.

IRINA.
Mother is buried in Moscow.

OLGA.
At the Novo-Devichi Cemetery.

MASHA.
Do you know, I'm beginning to forget her face. We'll be forgotten in just the same way.

VERSHININ.
Yes, they'll forget us. It's our fate, it can't be helped. A time will come when everything that seems serious, significant, or very important to us will be forgotten, or considered trivial. [Pause] And the curious thing is that we can't possibly find out what will come to be regarded as great and important, and what will be feeble, or silly. Didn't the discoveries of Copernicus, or Columbus, say, seem unnecessary and ludicrous at first, while wasn't it thought that some rubbish written by a fool, held all the truth? And it may so happen that our present existence, with which we are so satisfied, will in time appear strange, inconvenient, stupid, unclean, perhaps even sinful....

TUZENBACH.
Who knows? But on the other hand, they may call our life noble and honour its memory. We've abolished torture and capital punishment, we live in security, but how much suffering there is still!

SOLENI.
[In a feeble voice] There, there.... The Baron will go without his dinner if you only let him talk philosophy.

TUZENBACH.
Vassili Vassilevitch, kindly leave me alone. [Changes his chair] You're very dull, you know.

SOLENI.
[Feebly] There, there, there.

TUZENBACH.
[To VERSHININ] The sufferings we see to-day—there are so many of them!—still indicate a certain moral improvement in society.

VERSHININ.
Yes, yes, of course.

CHEBUTIKIN.
You said just now, Baron, that they may call our life noble; but we are very petty.... [Stands up] See how little I am. [Violin played behind.]

MASHA.
That's Andrey playing—our brother.

IRINA.
He's the learned member of the family. I expect he will be a professor some day. Father was a soldier, but his son chose an academic career for himself.

MASHA.
That was father's wish.

OLGA.
We ragged him to-day. We think he's a little in love.

IRINA.
To a local lady. She will probably come here to-day.

MASHA.
You should see the way she dresses! Quite prettily, quite fashionably too, but so badly! Some queer bright yellow skirt with a wretched little fringe and a red bodice. And such a complexion! Andrey isn't in love. After all he has taste, he's simply making fun of us. I heard yesterday that she was going to marry Protopopov, the chairman of the Local Council. That would do her nicely.... [At the side door] Andrey, come here! Just for a minute, dear! [Enter ANDREY.]

OLGA.
My brother, Andrey Sergeyevitch.

VERSHININ.
My name is Vershinin.

ANDREY.
Mine is Prosorov. [Wipes his perspiring hands] You've come to take charge of the battery?

OLGA.
Just think, Alexander Ignateyevitch comes from Moscow.

ANDREY.
That's all right. Now my little sisters won't give you any rest.

VERSHININ.
I've already managed to bore your sisters.

IRINA.
Just look what a nice little photograph frame Andrey gave me to-day. [Shows it] He made it himself.

VERSHININ.
[Looks at the frame and does not know what to say] Yes.... It's a thing that...

IRINA.
And he made that frame there, on the piano as well. [Andrey waves his hand and walks away.]

OLGA.
He's got a degree, and plays the violin, and cuts all sorts of things out of wood, and is really a domestic Admirable Crichton. Don't go away, Andrey! He's got into a habit of always going away. Come here!

[MASHA and IRINA take his arms and laughingly lead him back.]

MASHA.
Come on, come on!

ANDREY.
Please leave me alone.

MASHA.
You are funny. Alexander Ignateyevitch used to be called the lovelorn Major, but he never minded.

VERSHININ.
Not the least.

MASHA.
I'd like to call you the lovelorn fiddler!

IRINA.
Or the lovelorn professor!

OLGA.
He's in love! little Andrey is in love!

IRINA.
[Applauds] Bravo, Bravo! Encore! Little Andrey is in love.

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Goes up behind ANDREY and takes him round the waist with both arms] Nature only brought us into the world that we should love! [Roars with laughter, then sits down and reads a newspaper which he takes out of his pocket.]

ANDREY.
That's enough, quite enough.... [Wipes his face] I couldn't sleep all night and now I can't quite find my feet, so to speak. I read until four o'clock, then tried to sleep, but nothing happened. I thought about one thing and another, and then it dawned and the sun crawled into my bedroom. This summer, while I'm here, I want to translate a book from the English....

VERSHININ.
Do you read English?

ANDREY.
Yes father, rest his soul, educated us almost violently. It may seem funny and silly, but it's nevertheless true, that after his death I began to fill out and get rounder, as if my body had had some great pressure taken off it. Thanks to father, my sisters and I know French, German, and English, and Irina knows Italian as well. But we paid dearly for it all!

MASHA.
A knowledge of three languages is an unnecessary luxury in this town. It isn't even a luxury but a sort of useless extra, like a sixth finger. We know a lot too much.

VERSHININ.
Well, I say! [Laughs] You know a lot too much! I don't think there can really be a town so dull and stupid as to have no place for a clever, cultured person. Let us suppose even that among the hundred thousand inhabitants of this backward and uneducated town, there are only three persons like yourself. It stands to reason that you won't be able to conquer that dark mob around you; little by little as you grow older you will be bound to give way and lose yourselves in this crowd of a hundred thousand human beings; their life will suck you up in itself, but still, you won't disappear having influenced nobody; later on, others like you will come, perhaps six of them, then twelve, and so on, until at last your sort will be in the majority. In two or three hundred years' time life on this earth will be unimaginably beautiful and wonderful. Mankind needs such a life, and if it is not ours to-day then we must look ahead for it, wait, think, prepare for it. We must see and know more than our fathers and grandfathers saw and knew. [Laughs] And you complain that you know too much.

MASHA.
[Takes off her hat] I'll stay to lunch.

IRINA.
[Sighs] Yes, all that ought to be written down.

[ANDREY has gone out quietly.]

TUZENBACH.
You say that many years later on, life on this earth will be beautiful and wonderful. That's true. But to share in it now, even though at a distance, we must prepare by work....

VERSHININ.
[Gets up] Yes. What a lot of flowers you have. [Looks round] It's a beautiful flat. I envy you! I've spent my whole life in rooms with two chairs, one sofa, and fires which always smoke. I've never had flowers like these in my life.... [Rubs his hands] Well, well!

TUZENBACH.
Yes, we must work. You are probably thinking to yourself: the German lets himself go. But I assure you I'm a Russian, I can't even speak German. My father belonged to the Orthodox Church.... [Pause.]

VERSHININ.
[Walks about the stage] I often wonder: suppose we could begin life over again, knowing what we were doing? Suppose we could use one life, already ended, as a sort of rough draft for another? I think that every one of us would try, more than anything else, not to repeat himself, at the very least he would rearrange his manner of life, he would make sure of rooms like these, with flowers and light... I have a wife and two daughters, my wife's health is delicate and so on and so on, and if I had to begin life all over again I would not marry.... No, no!

[Enter KULIGIN in a regulation jacket.]

KULIGIN.
[Going up to IRINA] Dear sister, allow me to congratulate you on the day sacred to your good angel and to wish you, sincerely and from the bottom of my heart, good health and all that one can wish for a girl of your years. And then let me offer you this book as a present. [Gives it to her] It is the history of our High School during the last fifty years, written by myself. The book is worthless, and written because I had nothing to do, but read it all the same. Good day, gentlemen! [To VERSHININ] My name is Kuligin, I am a master of the local High School. [Note: He adds that he is a Nadvorny Sovetnik (almost the same as a German Hofrat), an undistinguished civilian title with no English equivalent.] [To IRINA] In this book you will find a list of all those who have taken the full course at our High School during these fifty years. Feci quod potui, faciant meliora potentes. [Kisses MASHA.]

IRINA.
But you gave me one of these at Easter.

KULIGIN.
[Laughs] I couldn't have, surely! You'd better give it back to me in that case, or else give it to the Colonel. Take it, Colonel. You'll read it some day when you're bored.

VERSHININ.
Thank you. [Prepares to go] I am extremely happy to have made the acquaintance of...

OLGA.
Must you go? No, not yet?

IRINA.
You'll stop and have lunch with us. Please do.

OLGA.
Yes, please!

VERSHININ.
[Bows] I seem to have dropped in on your name-day. Forgive me, I didn't know, and I didn't offer you my congratulations. [Goes with OLGA into the dining-room.]

KULIGIN.
To-day is Sunday, the day of rest, so let us rest and rejoice, each in a manner compatible with his age and disposition. The carpets will have to be taken up for the summer and put away till the winter... Persian powder or naphthaline.... The Romans were healthy because they knew both how to work and how to rest, they had mens sana in corpore sano. Their life ran along certain recognized patterns. Our director says: "The chief thing about each life is its pattern. Whoever loses his pattern is lost himself"—and it's just the same in our daily life. [Takes MASHA by the waist, laughing] Masha loves me. My wife loves me. And you ought to put the window curtains away with the carpets.... I'm feeling awfully pleased with life to-day. Masha, we've got to be at the director's at four. They're getting up a walk for the pedagogues and their families.

MASHA.
I shan't go.

KULIGIN.
[Hurt] My dear Masha, why not?

MASHA.
I'll tell you later.... [Angrily] All right, I'll go, only please stand back.... [Steps away.]

KULIGIN.
And then we're to spend the evening at the director's. In spite of his ill-health that man tries, above everything else, to be sociable. A splendid, illuminating personality. A wonderful man. After yesterday's committee he said to me: "I'm tired, Feodor Ilitch, I'm tired!" [Looks at the clock, then at his watch] Your clock is seven minutes fast. "Yes," he said, "I'm tired." [Violin played off.]

OLGA.
Let's go and have lunch! There's to be a masterpiece of baking!

KULIGIN.
Oh my dear Olga, my dear. Yesterday I was working till eleven o'clock at night, and got awfully tired. To-day I'm quite happy. [Goes into dining-room] My dear...

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Puts his paper into his pocket, and combs his beard] A pie? Splendid!

MASHA.
[Severely to CHEBUTIKIN] Only mind; you're not to drink anything to-day. Do you hear? It's bad for you.

CHEBUTIKIN.
Oh, that's all right. I haven't been drunk for two years. And it's all the same, anyway!

MASHA.
You're not to dare to drink, all the same. [Angrily, but so that her husband should not hear] Another dull evening at the Director's, confound it!

TUZENBACH.
I shouldn't go if I were you.... It's quite simple.

CHEBUTIKIN.
Don't go.

MASHA.
Yes, "don't go...." It's a cursed, unbearable life.... [Goes into dining-room.]

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Follows her] It's not so bad.

SOLENI.
[Going into the dining-room] There, there, there....

TUZENBACH.
Vassili Vassilevitch, that's enough. Be quiet!

SOLENI.
There, there, there....

KULIGIN.
[Gaily] Your health, Colonel! I'm a pedagogue and not quite at home here. I'm Masha's husband.... She's a good sort, a very good sort.

VERSHININ.
I'll have some of this black vodka.... [Drinks] Your health! [To OLGA] I'm very comfortable here!

[Only IRINA and TUZENBACH are now left in the sitting-room.]

IRINA.
Masha's out of sorts to-day. She married when she was eighteen, when he seemed to her the wisest of men. And now it's different. He's the kindest man, but not the wisest.

OLGA.
[Impatiently] Andrey, when are you coming?

ANDREY.
[Off] One minute. [Enters and goes to the table.]

TUZENBACH.
What are you thinking about?

IRINA.
I don't like this Soleni of yours and I'm afraid of him. He only says silly things.

TUZENBACH.
He's a queer man. I'm sorry for him, though he vexes me. I think he's shy. When there are just the two of us he's quite all right and very good company; when other people are about he's rough and hectoring. Don't let's go in, let them have their meal without us. Let me stay with you. What are you thinking of? [Pause] You're twenty. I'm not yet thirty. How many years are there left to us, with their long, long lines of days, filled with my love for you....

IRINA.
Nicolai Lvovitch, don't speak to me of love.

TUZENBACH.
[Does not hear] I've a great thirst for life, struggle, and work, and this thirst has united with my love for you, Irina, and you're so beautiful, and life seems so beautiful to me! What are you thinking about?

IRINA.
You say that life is beautiful. Yes, if only it seems so! The life of us three hasn't been beautiful yet; it has been stifling us as if it was weeds... I'm crying. I oughtn't.... [Dries her tears, smiles] We must work, work. That is why we are unhappy and look at the world so sadly; we don't know what work is. Our parents despised work....

[Enter NATALIA IVANOVA; she wears a pink dress and a green sash.]

NATASHA.
They're already at lunch... I'm late... [Carefully examines herself in a mirror, and puts herself straight] I think my hair's done all right.... [Sees IRINA] Dear Irina Sergeyevna, I congratulate you! [Kisses her firmly and at length] You've so many visitors, I'm really ashamed.... How do you do, Baron!

OLGA.
[Enters from dining-room] Here's Natalia Ivanovna. How are you, dear! [They kiss.]

NATASHA.
Happy returns. I'm awfully shy, you've so many people here.

OLGA.
All our friends. [Frightened, in an undertone] You're wearing a green sash! My dear, you shouldn't!

NATASHA.
Is it a sign of anything?

OLGA.
No, it simply doesn't go well... and it looks so queer.

NATASHA.
[In a tearful voice] Yes? But it isn't really green, it's too dull for that. [Goes into dining-room with OLGA.]
[They have all sat down to lunch in the dining-room, the sitting-room is empty.]

KULIGIN.
I wish you a nice fiancée, Irina. It's quite time you married.

CHEBUTIKIN.
Natalia Ivanovna, I wish you the same.

KULIGIN.
Natalia Ivanovna has a fiancé already.

MASHA.
[Raps with her fork on a plate] Let's all get drunk and make life purple for once!

KULIGIN.
You've lost three good conduct marks.

VERSHININ.
This is a nice drink. What's it made of?

SOLENI.
Blackbeetles.

IRINA.
[Tearfully] Phoo! How disgusting!

OLGA.
There is to be a roast turkey and a sweet apple pie for dinner. Thank goodness I can spend all day and the evening at home. You'll come in the evening, ladies and gentlemen....

VERSHININ.
And please may I come in the evening!

IRINA.
Please do.

NATASHA.
They don't stand on ceremony here.

CHEBUTIKIN.
Nature only brought us into the world that we should love! [Laughs.]

ANDREY.
[Angrily] Please don't! Aren't you tired of it?

[Enter FEDOTIK and RODE with a large basket of flowers.]

FEDOTIK.
They're lunching already.

RODE.
[Loudly and thickly] Lunching? Yes, so they are....

FEDOTIK.
Wait a minute! [Takes a photograph] That's one. No, just a moment.... [Takes another] That's two. Now we're ready!

[They take the basket and go into the dining-room, where they have a noisy reception.]

RODE.
[Loudly] Congratulations and best wishes! Lovely weather to-day, simply perfect. Was out walking with the High School students all the morning. I take their drills.

FEDOTIK.
You may move, Irina Sergeyevna! [Takes a photograph] You look well to-day. [Takes a humming-top out of his pocket] Here's a humming-top, by the way. It's got a lovely note!

IRINA.
How awfully nice!

MASHA.

           &nbsp        "There stands a green oak by the sea,
           &nbsp        And a chain of bright gold is around it...
           &nbsp        And a chain of bright gold is around it..."
[Tearfully] What am I saying that for? I've had those words running in my head all day....

KULIGIN.
There are thirteen at table!

RODE.
[Aloud] Surely you don't believe in that superstition? [Laughter.]

KULIGIN.
If there are thirteen at table then it means there are lovers present. It isn't you, Ivan Romanovitch, hang it all.... [Laughter.]

CHEBUTIKIN.
I'm a hardened sinner, but I really don't see why Natalia Ivanovna should blush....

[Loud laughter; NATASHA runs out into the sitting-room, followed by ANDREY.]

ANDREY.
Don't pay any attention to them! Wait... do stop, please....

NATASHA.
I'm shy... I don't know what's the matter with me and they're all laughing at me. It wasn't nice of me to leave the table like that, but I can't... I can't. [Covers her face with her hands.]

ANDREY.
My dear, I beg you. I implore you not to excite yourself. I assure you they're only joking, they're kind people. My dear, good girl, they're all kind and sincere people, and they like both you and me. Come here to the window, they can't see us here.... [Looks round.]

NATASHA.
I'm so unaccustomed to meeting people!

ANDREY.
Oh your youth, your splendid, beautiful youth! My darling, don't be so excited! Believe me, believe me... I'm so happy, my soul is full of love, of ecstasy.... They don't see us! They can't! Why, why or when did I fall in love with you—Oh, I can't understand anything. My dear, my pure darling, be my wife! I love you, love you... as never before.... [They kiss.]
[Two officers come in and, seeing the lovers kiss, stop in astonishment.]

[Verse 1: T.O.P, G-Dragon & Taeyang]
오랜만이야
못 본 사이
그댄 얼굴이 좋아 보여
예뻐졌다
넌 항상 내 눈엔 원래 고와 보여
근데 오늘따라 조금 달라 보여
유난히 뭔가 더 차가워 보여
나를 보는 눈빛이 동정에 가득 차 있어
네 앞에서 난 작아 보여
괜찮은 척 애써 대화 주제를 바꿔 버려
묻고 싶은 말은 많은데 넌 딱 잘라 버려
네 긴 머린 찰랑거려
내 볼을 때리곤 스쳐지나
뒤돌아선 곧장 가 버려
여기서 널 잡으면 우스워지나
아무 말도 떠오르지 않죠
떨면서 넌 한두 발짝 뒤로
이젠 내가 무섭단 그 말
날 미치게 하는 너란 달
[Chorus: Daesung & Taeyang]
I love you, baby
I'm not a monster
넌 알잖아, 예전 내 모습을
시간이 지나면 사라져 버릴 텐데
그땐 알 텐데, baby
I need you, baby
I'm not a monster
날 알잖아
이렇게 가지 마
너마저 버리면 난 죽어 버릴 텐데
I'm not a monster

[Verse 2: Seungri, G-Dragon & T.O.P]
무슨 일이 있어도 영원하자고
슬플 때도 기쁠 때도 끝까지 하자고
You don't say that tomorrow
오늘이 마지막인 것처럼 사랑하자고
Yo, 너 없는 삶은 종신형, 세상과 단절돼 돌 지경이야
너란 존재는 고질병, 시련의 연속, 마음속 미련이야
세상 사람들이 내게 돌린 등 (등)
모든 것이 배배 꼬여 있던 눈초리들
내게 가장 큰 아픔은 (아픔은)
네가 그들 같아졌단 것뿐

[Chorus: Daesung & Taeyang]
I love you, baby
I'm not a monster
넌 알잖아, 예전 내 모습을
시간이 지나면 사라져 버릴 텐데
그땐 알 텐데, baby
I need you, baby
I'm not a monster

마지막, 마지막, 마지막
네 앞에 서 있는 내 모습을 기억해 줘

[Intro: G-Dragon]
I’m tired of being alone
Sick of being single
I think I need me a girl
I need a girl like

[Verse 1: Taeyang]
One that speaks without thinking
Not a little child, but one that will embrace me
Not a girl that plays around sometimes when she’s bored
But one that will only love me
Even if she stays still and guys hand her their phone
That kind of girl that will proudly
Take out and show my picture

[Chorus 1: Taeyang]
Girl, I need a girl, pretty no matter what she does
A pretty body, too
Girl, I need a girl Baby, I need you
Girl, you need me, too

[Verse 2: Taeyang]
A kind of girl that looks better
In jeans than a skirt
A girl that will eat the kimchi fried rice
That I make instead
A girl who looks young even though she’s old
I like that kind of girl
(Know what I mean)

[Verse 3: Taeyang]
A girl that acts shy, but knows how to be bold
Always pretends to careful of her behavior
But when you’re with her
Hmm, y’all know what I’m talking about

[Chorus 2: Taeyang & G-Dragon]
Girl, I need a girl, pretty no matter what she does
A pretty body, too
Girl, I need a girl, I like this kind of girl

[Verse 4: G-Dragon]
Looks are not an issue but a cute girl who knows style
Even though our hobbies are different
Our tastes are the same
A girl that I can relate to a lot
When we watch movies or listen to music

[Verse 5: G-Dragon]
(Yes!) I love girls, girls I do adore
In front of people, she has principles as she plays
In front of me, she’s like “A’ing, I don’t know”
A voice that wakes me up in the morning
[Morning Kiss] I want to start the day
I’ll learn on your knees at night
As I listen to a lullaby, I want to dream of you

[Bridge: Taeyang]
Make my heart race again
Make me able to create sweet songs again
You know, it's not about the money or something like that
You’re the person I want to give my heart to

[Verse 6: Taeyang]
Girl, I need a girl, mmm
Girl like you, gotta make you mine
I’m treat you right, baby

[Chorus 1: Taeyang]
Girl, I need a girl, pretty no matter what she does
A pretty body, too
Girl, I need a girl, baby, I need you
Girl, you need me too

[Outro: Taeyang]
Girl, I need a girl
Girl, I need a girl
Girl, are you listening to me?
Baby, I need you, Girl, you need me, too
Girl, I need a girl

I'm gonna live my life slow, at a comfortable pace
They call me granddad, cause it's written all over my face
My behaviour's controlled
No need to make the most of tonight, 'cuz I'm gonna die old

Live fast die old

[Verse 1]
Not that old, 23
Got my life ahead of me
What's the point in having fun?
I'll do it when I'm 81
My favourite party's when nobody attends (You Know)
I'm in pants my watching a box set of Friends (For Sure)
[Break]
Oh my god... They're at it again (yeah)
Making my songs sound better again (double rhyme)
Parody is easy see, the words are right in front of me
Ke$ha is the best to do, cause her words are already poo

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Different song, same old shit
Long as it gets YouTube hits
MSN, after ten
You're really gonna do that joke again?
You thought that we'd be better, we been three years now together
Still got semen on my sweater from the one time we met Ke$ha
When I rap I slur, yes I got a lisp sir
Least I'm not rapping half pissed like Ke$ha

[Break]
Oh my god... They've done it once more (yeah)
Making a song that makes me look like a whore
Those gorgeous brits, they can't be controlled
The party don't start till we get old

[Bridge]
This is the part where we break it down
This is the part where we eat a clown
This is the part where the DJ skips
This is the part where we show our nips

When I cry that my Dad won't ever come back
But he's back...
Shut the FUCK up!!!
He's just an actor

[Intro: G-Dragon]
Ah
Baby, come back
A-yo, Choice, drop it on me
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
그날 밤은 내가 너무 심했어
네가 진짜로 떠나갈 줄은 몰랐어
"내가 미안해" 이 말 한마디 어려워서
우린 끝까지 가, 내 성격이 더러워서
말도 안 되는 일로 다투기를 하루에도 수십 번
넌 울면서 뛰쳐나가, 난 주위를 두리번
다시 돌아오겠지, 내일이면
분명 먼저 연락이 오겠지, 아침이면
[Pre-Chorus: Daesung, G-Dragon]
Baby, 난 못해, 너무나 못돼서

[Интро]
Чист

[Куплет 1]
Где же мы? Где же ты?
Где же я? Где же вы?
Что со мной? Я устал
Моя жизнь — вот мой страх
Кто же я? Кто же ты?
Мои сны — лишь мечты
Я не там — я не тот
Где мой знак? Я не смог
[Припев]
Я забыл, что значит жить
Я забыл все свои мысли
Мои слова словно числа
Мои слова словно числа
В каждом моменте — я лишний
В каждой вселенной  — я лишний
Все мои маски не видишь
Просто прошу вас, потише

[Куплет 2]
Я хочу уйти, я хочу назад
Я хочу забыть, я хочу во мрак
Снова этот сон, снова как назло
Снова этот день, снова я не тот
Все мои слова — всё это так зря
Затоптал свой путь — повернуть бы вспять
Чтобы и не ты — чтобы и не я
Чтобы и не жизнь, чтобы темнота

[Припев]
Я забыл что значит жить
Я забыл все свои мысли
Мои слова словно числа
Мои слова словно числа
Я забыл, что значит жить
Я забыл все свои мысли

Serius, Serius, Serius, let me hand you a tip
You battling a Prince, the Purple Rain king you see the kid in his great fit
I scream “Free Quincy!” that’s the same sound when it’s plane round
The Cheerio taste with the main style from James Brown
Now that I’m on they good foot I give em a straight kick
Great spit, you could tell by my Caesar I’m finna go ape shit
The goon who demand for the band put two in symphony
You doomed mentally, I’m who you called out
For saying I’m drawn out, that’s why they tune into me
I make the house sell, I’m who they adore, knock killing
All that hot grillin, get hit with the four man
You in fear to be hurt?
Jerk if this appear to be work, then we can get along, sure man
But if we can’t? He come back to win, he Siamese lunch
Chinese crunch, chin smashers, not to chase
Get in my rocket space, we’ll send NASA
Death, skin grafter, body line, puppet, fuck it I’m the pin master
Every round that I come in contact with
Show y’all that it’s nothing on the Lens Crafter
I’m past the faze, Church, half god, half man, I’m Hercules nigga
I scare the soul, Derrick Rose, I’m hurting these niggas
Please nigga, ya last catch was bass fresh, you who they sent to see
But you the staff rep for bad breath, this shit was meant to be
But it’s cold breath for the old ref, he been official
Old ref beneficial nigga you’ll probably die in a year
For the simpleton fans, I’m the Michelin man, I body entire careers
Wait soldier, don’t panic it’s the planet takeover
The plate holder, I terraform the terror, the goblin killer
Y’all know I’m a problem nigga, I’m from the era
When Mook, Lux left the game with the dead smell
It was passin for a stink
I held up, played Zelda, I had everybody asking for the Link
Jones don’t be phony, homie you know me, we decode the cold truth
I seen the totem pole, I was right there on that golden road too
I’m the same pup from the yellow brick road, but you who I’ma total dog
I black, Liberia, the god fearin the guy who meet every criteria
And that’s why I’m the pro to call (protocol)
Now they giving me crazy hugs, baby love, put me on a cupid card
Went from being the square-pants of the rap list, now I’m Patrick
The whole world calling me a stupid star
But that’s on every magazine print nigga
We press the issue on niggas who scared of loc’in
We hope he go but he Pinocchio
Boy would ride out but ya pedals broken
You wanna be a winner that much? If they write he could be cold
Gun like the Matrix too you're right it could reload
Dick head done got into a warm mess, you like the pussy hole
Defeat/the feet will swing in ya circle, you like to Tootsie Roll
But I rep Watts, that’s the team then
You knew I was gon come correct when you see men
Lyt across, I’m a writing boss, that’s why they call me king pin
This shit's a breeze, a ease then a sneeze when I met you niggas
God bless you niggas,I gotta rap, at the bottom slack
But I just might address you niggas
I flesh you niggas, I rest you niggas, the rest you niggas come and get me
Moral of the story, when I’m serious Serius, you not fuckin with me
Lyt…
SERIUS JONES

They said “you wanna battle on Ether vers’ Daylyt?”
I said “he gotta be just rap”
But as you can see soon as we get here, it’s like ya outfit
An obvious mismatch
I heard you was gon do some Inception thing
Ain’t that the beginning of something? Then that’s retarded
Cuz off the head this shit done already ended before it started
I heard Quill could see the definition to see if Quill was representing
But if it’s Quill as in penning something ill then that’s forgiving
But it’s not very gangster, in fact it’s not very clever as a nerd
Ask Mickey if this is Facts cuz I dissected the word
And Quill is a form in a thin tube and the main tailfeather of a bird
So that’s what you repping on ya neck? A thin tube or gay bird?
You mean to tell me a Crip from Watts
Writes his rhymes shaking a tailfeather? Say word
And you must be drinking ink to think Day writing is better
Oh I get it, you Quill cuz your bars they light as a feather
So the Queen Of The Ring wanna be the King Of The Dots
Until you get beamed out of this planet and since ya antics is all a scheme
Let’s make a scheme out of ya antics
I did the Math on you, try to sleep me on stage I’ll divide you in half
Till ya feet get splashed
Take them Spawn boots off you then ski on ya mask
Ya shine is a Thriller jacket, zip em up
If you the slave then I’m the master bruh
I’m on the Interstate in a Challenger with 3 Ks
Ready to put them white sheets on you so you could stay in character
See you not Batman Day, you not even Bruce Wayne you a liar
But I’ll tell you off the bat man, you so marked out
You should change ya last name to McGuire
See you gon die after the shit I say today to Day
It’s no more to combat when I put that gun in ya mouth
And say “don’t move” and you say “mkay mkay”
See you a booty shot, I couldn’t sell you light or tell you shake
And if I squeezed on you ya body would wind up so out of place
They could tell you fake
See if you wouldn’t tell not to be ya cell mate
I might could sell you weight
Now the Doctor’s gon have to wait til cells mate
To make the drugs they gotta help you take
I take this fool to a splash, turn ya bitch into a pool
Turn ya food into a bag, dripping through a tube
I get you blue like ya rag when you gripping on the tool
I’m flamed up like ya flag when you Bicken Back Bein Bool
You old day, but that’s okay cuz I bought the juice to Los Angeles
That mean I bring the steel with me, pinch ya bitch up over a Q
And they can't even tell who old man quill is
Old Man Quiles, Bishop, Juice, Steel, Los Angeles
I change ya ceiling but I don’t paint with ladders, these ladders they paint
You try to climb up in my window early morn’
Turn Spawn to a latter day Saint
You can’t pull a wool over a wolf’s eyes, I pull that wool up on em
My bars is so hard, niggas in the yard do pull-ups on em
Before y’all came on stage I hope y’all put some pull-ups on em
Cuz I’ma pull out on em soon as I pull up on em
See I’m the man that fucked Pam in San Fran and made the Bay-watch
Cave gun lines in ya face, you know how Tay Roc
Speaking of Roc, I don’t care how chiseled you are
Cuz pressure make diamonds but granted
You lost ya marbles, we diggin you
Show you how to get cooked on TV, no Emeril
Do this Amber Alert ass nigga biblical
Oh you don’t see where I’m going here yet?
I figured since he robbed the culture
So let’s give him the fate of the thief and stone him to death
I’m the one, you got more for us, never can never, that’s ya spaceship
Before you take the red pill hit em with a flying knee
Yo look like he was doing the Matrix
And I wasn’t gon say shit bout this gay shit
But let me get this straight, quick
Okay, so you a gangsta and a nerd, you a faggot and you straight
Who wears a mask over the mask you already tatted on ya face
So you Batman and you’re Spawn, you’re Daylyt and you’re Quill
But you know what that means, if you’re all those you’re nobody for real
I treat this like a drug deal, you might say why
Cuz my attitude is like the fiends, never cared if Day/they die
I remember when I was young nigga I tested some
I got shook, it had my brain fried
The point of the story is I ain’t get paranoid since I was Yay high
Ain’t no intervention can tame yo life
You like a coke head with a weak nose
You keep hitting the same line twice
You try to spoon me, I’ma pull the burner on this blue flame
You get tied up, shot, just for being a heroin vein (hero in vain)
I got that petico, ask Lush One, he knows
Address me and get violated if I’m P.O.’d
You thought I might slip and maybe lose a round, but no I reload
You about to get 84 grammed, nigga that’s 3 O’d
You go!

In the Math battle, you looked like me, yeah you stay fly
What you bout 6’3”? 6’4”? 6’4”?
Well after the Math punch you was ‘yay’ hi
Skill is something I could loan (cologne) you, but it might cost nigga
Patience, they say it’s hard to give cadence to the fragrance of a lost nigga
But I could tell by ya voice you smell like Detroit
That explains why his last round was decent (D scent)
I mean the man still don’t understand what I’m saying when I say
I’m concrete crippin, but nigga you gon find out what the C meant
Let’s put this stone
You ready to rock? Sure let’s get nastier than when they watch Borat
Based on what my mind crafted it’s gon put everybody in box format
I’m God, it’s true I got em los
Punches i land I’m too Bahamas los
Double bars I’m too Guantanamo
Piranha flow, snapping, rapping for the long drop, the crew Geronimo
You not for the drama, even my mama know, you too comical
It’s crucial, ya crew should vaminos, they gotta know
It’s only one I bitch, in this future I’ma show
In the future I’ma show nobody better
We don’t do gambling with females
The outer stop but the middle will/wheel continue
They like goddamn she on a Sprewell/spree well
That’s just the Watts route
Nigga I seen pop shoot up from the top couch
Since a kid I sense zones, it’s the Flinstones
Nigga I grew up in a rock house
Where every second it could happen nigga, K up beside the bed
Draw the chrome
I lay up with arms behind my head, I’m Karl Malone
But I said any second it could happen nigga
Pops told me never hesitate to slap a nigga
With the heater boy, it’s Vegeta boy, I’ll nap a (Nappa) nigga
Before I befriend you
I mean ya whole team look a lil sweet, they kinda Ginyu
I’ll amend you, all you can (shoryuken) be flames you tried the Ken move
Dollar menu, let’s keep it a buck
If the levees break for these geeks, it’s bad luck
We set it straight, I’m Kevin Gates, I’m just eating his ass up
Say hello to Daylyt, AKA Mr. Spazz Life
If we clash, it’s Steve Nash, I show you that I’m past nice
But I often wait, off the gate, you’ll find out what I’m fence to do
I chrome round money, I hope that make sense to you
No? Okay, they give Jones the start, it’s all play dough
Volcano, ya tip hold the spark
They call Day tho, it’s a Tornado, I come to rip homes apart
Shit, Jones a mark
They don’t know if ya bitch nigga, bitch bitch nigga
The bitch just Madea
But just know ya ass would be grass in a split second, “Ch-ch-ch-chia!”
Take a close look at my brother, thuggin like a mafucker
Tat on his face too nigga, you know the signs
Even my granny will clap, for a murkin fee she murk with ease
Nigga my whole family clap, “Hercules! Hercules!”
If the legends had a list, nigga you’d come in super last
You like Serena Williams, over the net you super ass
One line will smoke em, I got in my hookah stash
You like a cape on a garbage can, this nigga super trash
SERIUS JONES

That’s cute he came with the fam, but see I’m a forefather
But after son I see why battle rap’s missin me cuz look what they givin me
A nigga reppin Crip with the most red flags in battle rap history
But see I don’t just take off, I take offers
It’s too late for Daylyt’s Savings when I make Day darker
See I’m a vampire that ain’t scared of sun
And it’s time somebody put dog on a leash and I’m the Day walker
They asked me “why would I take this battle?”
I said cuz technically this is the most challenging position to be in
And if you don’t get it then peep then cuz I’ma give y’all the reason
See I been hit up by demons
I done battled in the prisons to the cement
I even last time on stage I had bitches twerkin
Y’all see when they shit on the P
But I never been on stage with a nigga that might start
Twerking, shitting or peeing
I mean, who raised you my nigga?
Well if it was ya moms then
And it wasn’t them grape street crips and Watts’n
I don’t get it cuz I know some killers from Bompton
Some 60’s from Carson, and them Jordan Down niggas is hard man
And I know they might string yo ass up
But I didn’t know they start letting niggas in thongs in
I can’t believe that over the C’s they ain’t sock you in yo head
For making the set look like some homemade G thang
Slow it down, I said I can’t believe that overseas
You had a sock on ya dickhead and a homemade G string
And we know this grape is a fruit
But I don’t know how y’all let him walk through y’all hood
Cuz now we know when he say he butt naked with the shotgun
He probably talking bout Suge
I don’t see the Lyt of Day, I heard he was a L evader (elevator)
Well I eat the same Rice as Ray, so let’s see what they ravin’ bout
Cuz when we riding in the streets, some things you can’t just write away
So let’s play a conversation out
Let’s say you crip walking down grape street, and see the homies
They deep and like “Aye Day, come smoke some this cookie it’s real loud”
What you gon say? “Aye wassup cuz, I’m just showing my ass for the set
You know I’m trying to make Tookie be proud
You only making noise cuz you a loud ass nigga
You know that “I’m not coming around if that nigga’s around” ass nigga
Sir cuz (Circus) like he the ring master and jump off trampoline
But need tricks to make it through a fire round ass nigga
I think we all know what we call those, clown ass niggas!
This bitch nigga see a gangbang and say “let’s be in” (lesbian)
Drama I bust too, fuck the DOC we could go there now
But when the pigs out fox him it’s “Momma I love you, POP hold it down”
I don’t see the law, yeah I’m legally blind just like shorty
You get one of mines booked, we wrap ya paperwork around the shank
Stick you with ya side of the story
See I shit on stages, you don’t shit on stages
You just be reaching and straining, that’s ya gut
You got a fight going on inside you so I take CLIPS, hit ya SOUL through ya ABs
Calm that shit down and break that shit up
And if you still got some OG’s Aktive, they should be very scared
Cuz they macking with wavy Jerry hair, and one spray at ya OG’s top
Activator everywhere
It’s mack in the arena, it’s on mack in the arena
And I brought that mac in the arena
It’s old but it’s still playing yeah that Mac’s a ringer
When you get hit, he won’t know if he lost his keys
Got hit six times or doing the Macarena
My demeanors meaner, I’m Kujo, no Boris, y’all singers
I make you collapse on stage
You won’t wake up out ya coma til August, Alsina
I told you stay on ya toes, but you put on a leotard and a cape
Fuck is you a ballerina?
For awhile now I was tied down by the same ropes I once showed niggas
Almost buried by the same shovels I gave gold diggers
For fifth’ers blazing in glory quote Jones scriptures
I was smacking cats off camera before Smack could even grow whiskers
I put in work! You job ass niggas is ass
I come through like a backwards Moses
Cuz after I part this C/sea then I lift up the staff
I feel Dre
Cuz I would’ve still been on Death Row if I let my division subtract his ass
But instead of the camera
I put the beats on him on the low so I could get back to stash
That’s how I got Shady after Math
Whats worse than a nigga that gets personal with you and turn on a nigga
These fuckers in the culture got me on fire like Ferguson, nigga
And I don’t mean the pigs when they did it
But I take this job cuz this only time
I could kill a nigga in front of the world and get away with it

Round 3
Daylyt

[Verse 3: Daylyt]

That’s what’s wrong with these stupid out-of-state niggas
Come to Cali and be lost’n
You dumb ass nigga, ain’t no 60’s up in Carson!
As the bottom stare, this is a step down to the king
We can actually see who the peasant, Jones
Don’t be mad cuz you got wrapped in a box, nigga
Just be happy to be in my presence (presents)
They said you was gifted when you battled Jin
All that mouth drilling and that’s what got ya feelings up
But the difference is you Clifford
The world consider you a big dog, but technically you still a pup
But guess what big dog?
You done stumbled in a puddle of defeat
I peeped ya two paws wet
You better get ready for the Chevy cuz, I’m who the crew call vets
But it’s magnificent, this where you get left frozen pussy
Cold twat, you know me, my M.O., G (Emoji)
One small sign could say a whole lot
But you notice first round I ain’t get personal
Second round I ain’t get personal, third round we get personal
This where it get gory bro
In my Mook voice, everybody wanna know so here’s how the story go
Lush One called me, I was getting some head…
He said we got a battle for you & it might involve you getting some bread
I said “Who is he?” he said “Serius” I said “Serious? This nigga dead!”
First thing I did was push P. Diddy off of the bed
On some real nigga G shit I used to think you was a cold killa
And everything changed right after the “wooo!” nigga
You told me verbatimly, before the Math battle, you like to squabble
30 minutes into the Math battle ya chin got hit, you like to wobble
I seen this cat walk then I seen Math run way, you like a model
If it was me he would’ve got a shell over that beef, you like the taco
He would’ve got chipped for the cheese, you like the nacho
The best luck for another stretch truck, you like a Tahoe
I would’ve lined up a round for this nigga, you like a waffle
Then put that same round next to the chicken, you like the Roscoe’s
I would’ve left his face all out of place, you like Picasso
Then I let it burn in here, you like a hot comb
Then I let it ring in the middle of ya face, you like 2Pac nose
Another serious nigga getting ripped in the middle of the club, you like Belasco's
But it’s a difference between Cali niggas and y’all niggas
When we get hit we rally niggas, John Sally niggas
Backshot, Ricky in the alley niggas
But the difference between us is these niggas walk up to a person and say
“If you need some help, I got ya”
A Cali nigga walk up to you like “aye homie you need some help?”
*Blocka! Blocka!*
But a raz on him, it’s time to spaz on him
Nigga I’m done with this nigga I’m bout to let the homie spaz on him
Vicious get him cuz…

Dre Vishiss:

[I took the sweet potato on the cannon and made can yams
Two burners, Jean and Claude, kicking out the Van, Damn
If I clap, turn victims into snacks when it boom boom and blam blam
Cuz all my bullets all they do is zoom zoom and wam wam nigga
If I clutch that heater it ain’t a buzzer beater
I should’ve been on Ether too so I’ma Ether you
Have you hiding from 2 5’s like niggas was playing peek-a-boo
Right here where these people be leaving you, I’ll be leaving you
I’m a motherfuckin monster with stripes, you’ll get ya Beetlejuice]

Beatz Gatlin:

[I don’t wanna hear no bars
About nobody from my la familia you familiar with
Daylyt is Daylyt, that’s that nigga
I’ll slap niggas and that’s facts, anybody could get familiar with]

SERIUS JONES

See y’all be knowing Jones, b
I accept a whole fee with my palms high like a coconut tree
Ironic a nigga reppin purple is now sour and wanna get higher
While trying to smoke the OG
But see my shots swisher, my speech finish like I’m Dutch
I could have ya entourage tubed up, but I roll old school
I’d rather hit the lick and rip off the paper after I empty ya guts
Good morning, scope in ya mouth, clear out a distance
That gun smoke aroma it’ll choke ya, air out the witness
I move forest, ya Inglewood could share my statistics
Ya OG while you was on ya side kicking booboos
I was on my grizzly; I put Smokey The Bear out of business
Y’all probably got some fire that been burned by you
Cuz I had a grow house in LA with some nerds I knew
He thought the Mob was Goodie he tried “peeking in the window”
Trying to see the herb I grew
I put the Eagle in Quill’s face just so I could give him a bird’s eye view
I played with toys since a boy, my Armstrong so I stretch more
I Chutes with Ladders, if the chips fall where they may then I connect four
I heard Bobby Johnson is like South Central
They make it whisper when they throw lead
So deuce deuce, pull out the stash
Take out the nose and let you meet Mr. Potato Head
You don’t want ya kid to be an orphan, do you?
Look at me king, I’m talking to you
Ya name’s Day right? Alright
You thinking ya son/sun will be most important to you
You know he gon Google ya legacy one day
The banana splits was sweet enough
But the doo doo brown syrup
That’s gon be the cherry on top for ya son day (Sundae)
See you know what, I get it, you don’t care about being wealthy
You got ya whole clique in here
You getting embarrassed lookin crazy and y’all taking selfies
I’m doing you greasy and I’ma rub it in cuz you flaky as goat skin
I get the itch, ankle strap, where I keep that cal of mine? Low shin (calamine lotion)
Bump me? And I grab what I wear on my pants leg
Show you I’m a Patriot when I start airing, her and Diz (Aaron Hernandez)
See you can’t beat me with Batman or Spawn’s powers
This god hour, ya soft coward bars sound like talking flowers on powder
Talk louder, walk louder, spark wilder
Your raps Al Qaida
Cuz ya fly is too plain to blow up, lost towers
I rep the east but we respect the west where I’m from
They ask me do they got bars, I say “bar-none” Is there comp? Tons (Compton)
But if you ain’t from neighborhoods and you riding in the city
Stay in ya car, son (Carson)
My East Los Vatos don’t play
Ya bitch get gangbanged and sexed in the Chola way
Brought her to my homes, I said “Jones, no you don’t have to pay
Cuz see ma, she audele
See it's some freaks you can bank on
That leave you down by the riverside when they blast the nina
Even Ms. Howard said she’d be a freak until the Day but this is
Past Adina/Pasedena
See I mack until I’m down on my last with 10 toes
In the Bay with a bag of pills, it’s look like a sac of mentos (Sacremento)
See I heard niggas from Watts was live wires
And they let them guns blow proudly
But he was talking about letting the pounds go on camera
But he was quiet in New York, I said maybe you’re from Humble County
See you play a lot of gun games but this ain’t Halo kid
Cuz I turn this to City Of God, let that metal ring over ya head
Send you to where ya lost angel is (Los Angeles)
My clip full these niggas been scared
It’s like a fat bitch with a waist trainer
So what it’s hanging out the bottom
I’m still gon squeeze everything in here
I’ll blow out Kevin’s heart  for the right price nigga
Aye Daylyt, you ever go ‘night night’ nigga?
Matter fact niggas sleep when you on, you ain’t Day, you night Lyt nigga
You don’t even like dark skin niggas, you homo, you like light niggas

Over jungle sound effects, the CAMERA is low, moving through brush from the POV of a stalking animal. As the brush parts, revealing Wall Street and the New York Stock Exchange, we HEAR the resonant voice of GENE HACKMAN.

GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) The world of investing can be a jungle.

1A	WE SEE a charging, snorting BULL.	1A

GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Bulls.

1B	WE SEE a ferocious, growling BEAR.	1B
GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Bears. Danger at every turn.

Pretentious CLASSICAL MUSIC kicks in.

GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) That’s why we at Stratton Oakmont pride ourselves on being the best.

1C-1D	VARIOUS SHOTS -- a conservative young MAN reviews a stock 1C-1D portfolio with a wealthy older COUPLE; a smiling young
WOMAN sits before a computer talking into a headset.

GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Trained professionals to guide you through the financial wilderness.

1E	WE SEE the Stratton “team” - an ethnically diverse group	1E of ACTORS with their handsome, grey-templed “CHAIRMAN”.

GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Stratton Oakmont. Stability. Integrity. Pride.

1F	WE SEE a shot of the black glass Stratton Building, and:	1F


2	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (FEB ‘95)	2

Absolute bedlam. 300 drunken STOCKBROKERS, most in their early 20s, chant wildly as JORDAN BELFORT, handsome, 30, stands beside a DWARF dressed in tights, cape & helmet.

JORDAN
Twenty five grand to the first cocksucker to nail a bullseye!

The “bullseye” is a large dollar sign in the middle of a giant velcro “dartboard”.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	2.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Watch and learn, people!

The Brokers go apeshit as Jordan grabs the Dwarf by his pants and collar. In the Crowd, cash flies as side bets are made. Jordan winds up, aims for the “dartboard”.

JORDAN (CONT’D) One. Two. Throw!!

The Brokers cheer, and as the screaming Dwarf takes flight, hurtling toward camera, we FREEZE FRAME:

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
My name is Jordan Belfort. No, not	* him, me. I’m a former member of	* the middle class raised by two
accountants in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.


3-3B	A SERIES OF POLAROIDS -- (1969)	3*-3B

Jordan, 7, smiles as he poses behind a lemonade stand, his parents Max and Leah behind him; Jordan, 13, stands holding a styrofoam cooler, selling ices on the beach; Jordan, 18, smiles as he holds an Amway sales brochure.

JORDAN (V.O.) The year I turned 26, I made 49 million dollars as the head of my own brokerage firm--


4	EXT. LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY - DAY (FEB ‘95)	4

A CHERRY RED Ferrari Testarossa ZOOMS down the L.I.E.

JORDAN (V.O.) --which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.
The Ferrari weaves in and out of traffic.

JORDAN (V.O.) Hey, my Ferrari was white, like Don Johnson’s in Miami Vice.

We see the same Ferrari, now in WHITE, as it zooms away, a BLONDE head bobbing up and down in Jordan’s lap.


5	EXT. LONG ISLAND’S NORTH SHORE - DAY (FEB ‘95)	5

A twin-engine Bell Jet helicopter descends over a huge mansion, with sparkling pool, tennis court and waterfall.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	3.


JORDAN (V.O.) See that humongous estate down there? That’s my house.


6	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	6

We see NAOMI, 24, blonde and gorgeous, a living wet dream in LaPerla lingerie.

JORDAN (V.O.)
My wife, Naomi, the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, a former model and Miller Lite girl.

Naomi licks her lips; she’s incredibly, painfully hot.

JORDAN (V.O.) Yeah, she was the one blowing me in the Ferrari, so put your dick back in your pants.

Over the following, WE SEE a quick


7-7C	SERIES OF SHOTS	7-7C

All taken from TV; a mansion from Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous; wealthy PEOPLE applauding at a polo match; a yacht sailing crystal blue seas; Robert Wagner and
Stephanie Powers toasting with champagne on Hart to Hart.

JORDAN (V.O.)
In addition to Naomi and my two perfect kids, I own a mansion, private jet, six cars, three horses, two vacation homes and a 170 foot yacht.


8	INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT (FEB ‘95)	8

Sweaty, wild-eyed and naked, Jordan fucks an HISPANIC HOOKER from behind.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I also gamble like a degenerate, drink like a fish, fuck hookers maybe five times a week and have three different Federal agencies looking to indict me.

He dismounts, snorts some coke through a straw, then uses it to blow some into her asshole.

JORDAN (V.O.) Oh yeah, and I love drugs.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	4.


Jordan looks up suddenly, paranoid, as if he’s hearing voices.


9	INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT (FEB ‘95)	9

Jordan, drooling and stoned out of his skull, wears a rumpled custom-made business suit as he mans a set of controls next to his frantic co-pilot, CAPTAIN DAVE.


Pull up! crash!!
CAPTAIN DAVE Jesus! We’re gonna

Jordan’s head bobs as he pulls back on the stick.
The helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering 30 feet above a huge mansion. Down below, through Jordan’s hazy, DOUBLE VISIONED POV, we see a sparkling pool, tennis court and waterfall.

JORDAN (V.O.) Check this out -- despite my completely fucked-up state, I could fly straight while still seeing two of everything.

He closes one eye; his POV sharpens. Putting pressure on the stick, the helicopter descends slowly over the driving range... then LURCHES and SLAMS to the ground.

JORDAN (to Captain Dave)
Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay, buddy.


10	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - FRONT DOOR - DAY (FEB ‘95)	10

Morning. Sober now, impeccable in suit and tie, Jordan heads for the door holding a glass of orange juice.

JORDAN (V.O.) Yes, on a daily basis I take enough drugs to sedate greater Long Island.


11	EXT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - CONTINUOUS (FEB ‘95)	11

He pops two white pills, swigs some juice, then speaks
directly to the camera as he heads for a waiting limo.

JORDAN
I take Quaaludes for my back, fifteen to twenty a day.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	5.

JORDAN (CONT'D) I use Xanax to stay focused, ambien to sleep, pot to mellow out, cocaine to wake up and morphine because it’s awesome.


12	EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - LONG ISLAND - DAY (FEB ‘95)	12

The limo pulls up to the black glass office building. Jordan gets out, heads inside through a back door.

JORDAN
But of all the drugs under God’s blue heaven, there’s one that’s my absolute favorite.


13	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY (FEB ‘95) 13

Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. With the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk. As he peels a crisp $100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad, rolls it up:

JORDAN
Enough of this shit’ll make you invincible, able to conquer the world and eviscerate your enemies.

He SNARFS up the line, gestures to the cocaine.

JORDAN (CONT’D) I’m not talking about this. I’m talking about this.
(Jordan unfurls the $100 with a SNAP)
Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive.

He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner, where it comes to rest with two dozen others. Over his back as we TRACK HIM out of his office toward what sounds like the ROAR of a mob--

JORDAN (V.O.) Money doesn’t just buy you a
better life -- better food, better cars, better pussy -- it also makes you a better person. You can give generously to the church of your choice or the political party. You can save the fucking spotted owl with money.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	6.


14	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (FEB ‘95)	14

Arms akimbo, Jordan stands above the bullpen, a huge open space with tightly packed rows of maple colored desks.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But most of all, in any country in the world, money can buy you love. Fuck the Beatles.

His 300 BROKERS, mostly young men with their jackets off, scream wildly. They worship him.

JORDAN (V.O.) With that in mind, at the tender age of 22, after marrying my girlfriend Teresa--


14A	SCENES 14A - 18 OMITTED	14A


19	EXT. WALL STREET - DAY (MAY ‘87)	19

An express bus pull up -- its sign reads “Wall Street”....

JORDAN (V.O.)
--I headed to the only place that befit my high-minded ambitions...

Jordan emerges, kisses TERESA goodbye, then joins a sea of Commuters heading to work.

JERRY FOGEL (PRE-LAP) You are lower than fucking pond scum.


20	INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY (MAY ‘87)	20

Computers, telephones everywhere. At their desks, 45 shirt-sleeved BROKERS read their Wall St. Journals, readying for war. Like an eager puppy, Jordan follows broker JERRY FOGEL, 30, thick-lipped and bow-tied...

JERRY FOGEL You got a problem with that?
(reads name tag) Jordan?

JORDAN Nope. No problem at all.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	7.


JERRY FOGEL Your job is ‘connector’, which
means you'll be dialing the phone over 500 times a day, trying to ‘connect’ me with business owners. And till you pass your Series 7, that’s all you’ll be doing. Sit.

Jordan takes a seat at the desk next to Fogel’s.

JERRY FOGEL (CONT’D) Just so you know, last year I made over 300k and the other guy you'll be working for made a million.

JORDAN (V.O.)
A million dollars? I could only imagine what a douchebag that guy must be.

A manicured hand lands on Jordan’s shoulder. It’s MARK HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.

MARK HANNA Jordan? Mark Hanna.
(re: Fogel)
Good, you’ve met Jerry. One of the smartest guys in the office. Who’s ever sucked a dog’s cock out of loneliness.

Fogel’s smile turns to a frown. He hands Jordan a stack of 3x5 index cards.

JERRY FOGEL Smile and dial. And don’t pick your fucking head up till one.

MARK HANNA
Don’t mind Jerry, his father raped him as a child. Besides, I'm senior broker here, he's a worthless piker. I heard you pitched stock at your job interview.

JORDAN
Had to do something to stand out.

MARK HANNA
I fuckin’ love that! Let’s grab lunch later. Windows good with you?

JORDAN Great. Yeah.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	8.


Hanna gives him a wink, looks at the clock on the giant electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.

MARK HANNA Let’s fuck!!

RING!!! Absolute pandemonium at the BELL signalling the opening of the stock market. Feet fly off desks; Brokers and their Connectors dial phones like mad. The CAMERA PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR.

BROKER #1 (to Broker #2)
Miniscribe's a fuckin’ steal! Thirty eight bucks a share!

MARK HANNA (into headset)
Your broker in West Virginia? What are you buying, a coal mine? It's the 80s, the game is high-tech.

BROKER #2 (to Broker #3)
Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!

JORDAN (V.O.)
You want to know what money sounds like? Visit a trading floor on Wall Street. Fuck this, shit that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I couldn’t believe how these guys talked to each other--

Fogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen. He covers his mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.

JERRY FOGEL Dial the cocksucking phone!

Jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.

JORDAN (V.O.) I was hooked within seconds.

Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a “buy” ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.

JORDAN (V.O.)
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and we’re suddenly--
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	9.


21	INT. WINDOWS ON THE WORLD - DAY (MAY ‘87)	21

CLOSE ON a COKE SPOON whose contents disappear up a nostril. PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

The lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the city. At a corner table, a paranoid Jordan looks around as Hanna does another bump of coke. None of the other DINERS seem to notice or care.

MARK HANNA (offering the spoon)
Got enough for one more? Tootski?

JORDAN No. Thanks though.

Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the tuxedoed Maitre’D, approaches.

HECTOR
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?

Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan notices.

MARK HANNA Here’s the game plan, Hector. Bring us two Absolut Martinis
straight up. Precisely seven and a half minutes after you deliver those you’ll bring two more, then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out.

HECTOR
An excellent strategy, sir.

JORDAN Actually, I’m good with 7-Up.

Jordan might as well have farted at the table.

MARK HANNA
First day on Wall Street, Hector. Give him time.
(Hector offers menus) No thanks, I’m not eating.

Hector heads off.

JORDAN
You can get high during the day and still function?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	10.


MARK HANNA
High is the only way to do this fucking job. Guy who coined the term “three-martini lunch” was a woman. Cocaine and hookers, my friend, the keys to success.

Jordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding.

JORDAN
I gotta say, I’m really excited about being part of your team. I wanna do all I can for our clients and --

MARK HANNA (reciting an ad)
“Here at L.F. Rothschild, our clients aren’t just important, they’re family.” Just as long as we get our taste first. Remember something, Jordan, your top priority in this job: make us money. If the clients get rich along the way, bully for them. Got a girlfriend?

JORDAN Wife. She cuts hair.

Mark swallows a comment about that. Gets to business.

MARK HANNA
OK, first rule of Wall Street. Nobody -- and I don’t care if you’re Warren Buffet or Jimmy Buffet -- nobody knows if a stock’s going up, down or fucking sideways, least of all stock brokers. But we have to pretend we know. Make sure you stay relaxed. Nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they haven’t gotten laid in a month. Take breaks when you feel stressed, jerk off if you can. You like jerking off, right?

JORDAN Well... sure.

MARK HANNA
Good, jerking off is key. And I highly recommend cocaine, which will make you dial faster, which is good for me. Churn ‘em and burn ‘em, baby.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	11.


A BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks him. Then, discreetly as possible, Mark removes a fresh vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort. Jordan realizes: that’s why he palmed the maitre d’ $100.

JORDAN (V.O.)
For the next six months I learned the ways of Wall Street.


22	INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT (OCT ‘87)	22

As STRIPPERS grind in b.g, Jordan parties with Mark Hanna and dozens of BROKERS and TRAINEES. Jordan sips a martini and studies Mark Hanna, hitting on a STRIPPER.

JORDAN (V.O.) That fall I passed my Series 7. Finally it was here.


23	INT. ROTHSCHILD BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY (OCT ‘87)	23

Briefcase in hand, Jordan boards the elevator with a dozen other BROKERS.

JORDAN (V.O.)
My first day as a stockbroker, a future Master of the Universe.

And as the doors close, on screen WE SEE:

OCTOBER 19th, 1987


24	INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY (OCT ‘87)	24

Total chaos. Jordan dials the phone as all around him Brokers panic, screaming into headsets.

JORDAN (V.O.) They called it Black Monday.
By four p.m. the market was down 508 points, the biggest one-day drop since the crash of ‘29.

4 p.m. The closing bell RINGS; the entire place goes silent. Brokers look at each other, stunned.

MARK HANNA Holy. Fucking. Shit.

And as the Brokers start commiserating with each other...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	12.


JORDAN (V.O.) L.F. Rothschild, a company that had been in business since 1883, closed its doors within a month.


25	INT. JORDAN & TERESA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (DEC ‘87)	25

Jordan sits at the table perusing the Times classifieds. Teresa approaches with two coffees. Sits next to him.

TERESA
So I’ll take an extra shift, don’t worry about it.

JORDAN
You work too much as it is.

TERESA
We could pawn my engagement ring.

JORDAN
We’re not pawning anything. I’m gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.

TERESA
You know that doesn’t matter, right?

He smiles, kisses her. Together, they peruse the ads.

JORDAN (points to an ad)
“Nobody Beats the Wiz”. I could be a stock boy.

TERESA You’re a stock broker.

JORDAN
No one’s hiring brokers right now, sweetie.

They go back to the ads. After a few beats, she points--

TERESA This place is.


26	EXT. STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - LONG ISLAND - DAY (DEC ‘87) 26

In a suit, Jordan emerges from an ‘85 Datsun. He looks around confused, heads toward an unmarked storefront.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	13.


27	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - DAY (DEC ‘87)	27

The antithesis of L.F. Rothschild, with cheap furniture and a dozen misfit “BROKERS” giving loud, obnoxious sales pitches. Jordan enters, a modern man among cave people. DWAYNE, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.

JORDAN
I’m looking for Investor’s Center?

DWAYNE That’s us, hey. Dwayne.

JORDAN
(as they shake hands) Jordan Belfort, I called earlier. I was a broker with Rothschild.

Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat. Nearby, a Broker in ratty Keds, TOBY WELCH, is screaming into his phone.

TOBY WELCH
I’m tellin’ you, this stock is goin’ up!... Cause I know, okay?!... I have inside information!

Jordan looks at him, appalled at what he’s hearing.

JORDAN Where are your quotrons?

DWAYNE
No quotrons, we sell off the pink sheets -- penny stocks.

Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are literally pink. He explains as Jordan flips the pages:

DWAYNE (CONT’D) Company don’t have enough capital to be listed on NASDAQ, their shares trade here.
(points to the book)
Like these guys, Aerotyne? They make radar detectors out of a garage in Dubuque.

JORDAN
Six cents a share? Who buys this crap?

DWAYNE Schmucks mostly. Mailmen,
plumbers, people thinking they can get rich quick. They answer our ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	14.


JORDAN
The spread on these is huge.

DWAYNE
So’s your commission, that’s the point. Blue chips stocks you get what, one percent? Pink sheets are fifty.

JORDAN
Wait a second. You’re telling me if I sell two thousand dollars worth of stock, my commission is a thousand bucks?

DWAYNE Technically, yeah, but not even the biggest schmuck buys two thousand dollars of this shit.


28	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY (DEC ’87)	28

As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then:

JORDAN (into phone)
Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan Belfort with Investor’s Center in New York City. You recently responded to one of our ads...

A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.

JORDAN (CONT’D) The reason I’m calling is that an extremely exciting investment
opportunity crossed my desk today. Typically our firm recommends no more than five stocks per year: this is one of them...

A few more Brokers look over...

JORDAN (CONT'D) Aerotyne International is a cutting edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of radar equipment...

LATER. Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	15.


JORDAN (CONT’D) -- so if Aerotyne’s shares rise to only a dollar -- and our
research indicates they could go much, much higher -- your profit on a mere three thousand dollar investment would be upwards of fifty thousand... That’s right, you could pay off your mortgage.

Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:

JORDAN (CONT’D) Four thousand dollars, will that be check or money order?... Thank you, sir.

Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a “buy” ticket.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) Just like that I made two grand.
The other guys looked at me like I’d just discovered fire.

Toby Welch and the other cave-Brokers stare at him.

TOBY WELCH How’d you fuckin’ do that?


29	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - (ANOTHER) DAY (FEB ‘88)	29

Jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused.

JORDAN
It’s a rock-solid company, sir, it’s the next Microsoft...
Six thousand. Terrific.

As Jordan continues talking, wrapping up the sale...

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) Though I knew I was selling
garbage, within twelve weeks I was making a fortune.

And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...

JORDAN (V.O.) And as a wise man once told me, my only responsibility was to put meat on the table.

CLOSE ON a 1988 Jaguar, parked outside a diner...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	16.


30	INT. KACANDES DINER - BAYSIDE - DAY (JUN ‘88)	30

Wearing a suit, Jordan sits in a booth reading the Wall Street Journal as a WAITRESS serves the food. DONNIE AZOFF, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright white teeth approaches from the takeout counter.

DONNIE That your Jag in the lot?


Yeah.


Nice ride.
JORDAN


DONNIE Donnie Azoff.

JORDAN Jordan Belfort.

DONNIE
I’ve seen it around. We live in the same building. Twelfth floor?
(Jordan nods) What do you do, bro?

JORDAN Stock broker.

DONNIE
Kids furniture, me and my brother-in-law. Making any money?

JORDAN Seventy grand last month.

DONNIE
Get the fuck out. You made seventy grand in one month.

JORDAN Seventy two actually.

Donnie studies him, isn’t sure if he’s full of shit.

DONNIE
Tell you what. You show me a pay stub with $72,000 on it, I’m quitting my job right now and coming to work with you.

As Jordan retrieves his briefcase to find a paystub --	*

30A	SCENE 30A OMITTED	*30A

30B	As Jordan hands Donnie his paystub and sure enough, it’s	*30B north of seventy-two k.	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	17.


DONNIE (CONT’D)	* Holy shit.

Jordan watches as Donnie crosses to a pay phone and dials.

JORDAN (V.O.) And he did quit his job, which I thought was a little weird. I mean I had just met this fucking guy.

A few beats, then into phone:

DONNIE
Yo Paulie, it’s Donnie... Yeah, listen, I quit.

Jordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation...

JORDAN (V.O.) There were other things about him
too, like his phosphorescent white teeth and the fact that he wore horn rims with clear lenses to look more Waspy. He also married his first cousin --

31	SCENE 31 OMITTED	31


32	INT. BAR - DAY (JUN ‘88)	*32

Jordan sits in mid-conversation with Donnie over beers.

DONNIE
No problem, if we have a kid who’s a retard, we’ll just leave it on the steps of some institution.

And as they continue drinking...

JORDAN (V.O.)
He was also a closet drug fiend. I’d known him less than a week before he talked me into smoking crack.


33	EXT. BACK OF BAR - DAY (JUN ‘88)	*33

Jordan and Donnie get high. Donnie holds a flame under a crack pipe.

The weird thing was when he’d do crack, his face would contort into this bizarre, frozen mask like the Phantom of the Opera.

Donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his facial muscles contort, locking up like a stroke victim. After a few beats, he hands the pipe to Jordan.

DONNIE You now, take a hit!

Jordan takes a deep hit and holds it. A beat, then:

JORDAN Omigod, I fuckin’ love you!!

JORDAN (V.O.) I knew I had to make him my partner.


34	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - DAY (SEP ‘88)	34

Jordan looks on as Donnie works the phone like a madman.

JORDAN (V.O.) Which turned out to be a great move - Donnie was a fast learner who transitioned into the penny stock business quickly.


35	EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP - DAY (SEP ‘88)	35

Jordan and Donnie pull up to a defunct auto body shop, which has a “For Lease” sign in the window.

JORDAN (V.O.)
So within months we started our own firm out of an abandoned auto body shop.


36	INT. KACANDES DINER - DAY (OCT ‘88)	36

Jordan sits with CHESTER MING, ROBBIE FEINBERG, ALDEN KUPFERBERG (”SEA OTTER”) and BRAD, muscular and bald, with a Fu Manchu mustache.

JORDAN (V.O.) In addition to Donnie, I also
recruited my friends Sea Otter,	* Chester and Robbie, who were at	* the time all middling pot dealers.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	19.


As a WAITRESS serves cheeseburgers:

JORDAN
--see everyone wants to get rich, so you’re already half way there by the time the call starts.

SEA OTTER
I sold weed once to this Amish dude, had one of those beards with no mustache?

ROBBIE FEINBERG So?

SEA OTTER
He only wanted to make furniture.

CHESTER MING What’s that got to do with anything?

SEA OTTER
He just said everyone wants to get rich.

ROBBIE FEINBERG (to Jordan)
That’s true, you did.

SEA OTTER Buddhists too, they don’t give a shit about money either.

CHESTER MING
Man I could sell weed to anybody, get a convent full of nuns fucking wasted.

And as Brad looks at Jordan and shakes his head:


37	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN	37 (OCT ‘88)

We see the above guys working the phones.

JORDAN (V.O.) Brad, the guy I really wanted,
took a pass, since he’d become the Quaalude king of Bayside.


38	EXT. BRAD’S HOUSE - BACKYARD GYM - DAY (OCT ‘88)	38

Bare-chested, wearing kung fu pants, Brad sells ludes to a couple of HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.

JORDAN (V.O.) They were absolute morons, my
friends, but like I always said--


39	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN - DAY	39 (OCT ‘88)

Jordan emerges from his office into the garage area
(the bullpen), looking on as Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Sea Otter and four other BROKERS (now including RUGRAT and Toby) make sales calls from the cheap desks.

JORDAN (V.O.) Give me them young, hungry and stupid and in no time I’ll make them rich.


40	EXT. MARINA - LONG ISLAND - SUNSET (MAY ‘89)	40

On lounge chairs at the edge of a dock, bottle of wine nearby, Jordan sits with Teresa. He smiles as she opens a jewelry case -- inside is a diamond tennis bracelet.

TERESA Omigod. Jordan.

JORDAN You like it?

TERESA It’s beautiful.

Jordan helps her try it on. She smiles, but he detects a wave of... something.

JORDAN
They’re small, I know, but the stones are really high quality.

TERESA No, no. I love it.


Then what?

They sit in silence.
JORDAN


Finally:

TERESA
I don’t know, it’s just -- these stocks, these crappy companies.

JORDAN
In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	21.


TERESA
Why can’t you be legitimate now?

JORDAN It’s not illegal, Teresa,
technically. I mean they’re real stocks, they’re just...

TERESA
Never gonna make anybody money. (a few beats; then)
Wouldn’t you feel better selling this junk to rich people, who can afford to lose the money at least?

JORDAN
Rich people don’t buy penny stocks.

TERESA Why not?

And on Jordan’s look:

JORDAN (V.O.) Because they’re too smart, that’s why not.


41	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - DAY (AUG ‘89)	41

CLOSE ON Jordan, brow furrowing as his wheels turn.

JORDAN (V.O.) I mean what person of any

Well, you can probably figure that out for yourself.


47	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT	47 (MAR ‘90)

The camera PUSHES IN on Jordan as he stands before a large dry erase board.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But what if they didn’t sound like jerk-offs? What if I took this bunch of nincompoops and molded them in my own image? I reinvented the company, gave it a new image, a new name. Something patrician, blue-blooded, something that reeked of tradition and anti-semitism.

And as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs--

JORDAN Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton
Oakmont. The clients we’ve gone after in the past -- they’re done. We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of Americans. The methods we’ve used -- over. Loud, obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	23.

JORDAN (CONT'D)
In military terms it’s like carpet-bombing -- noisy, menacing and only marginally effective. As Stratton brokers you will be laser-guided smart-bombs aimed at high-priority targets. You will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks -- then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets, where the real money is. Now the key to every sale is this:

Jordan writes the word “URGENCY” on the board.

JORDAN (CONT’D)
No one buys stock unless he thinks it’s going up and going up now. You must convince your client to buy before the takeover happens, before the lawsuit is settled, before the patent is granted.
If he says I’ll think about it and call you back, it’s over, you’re dead! No one calls back! So you have to create urgency --


48	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	48

Another day. With Stratton Oakmont signage visible in the b.g., Jordan is on speakerphone with a potential CLIENT, the other Brokers listening in.

JORDAN
--and once Kodak settles the lawsuit, institutions will be permitted to buy their shares in large blocks again. And when that happens, which is any day now, what do you think will happen to the price of Kodak stock?

CLIENT (O.S.) It’ll go up?

JORDAN
Exactly. Which is why you should pick up 5000 shares today, a $200,000 investment.


49	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT	49

Jordan stands addressing his Brokers.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	24.


JORDAN
Then you lower your voice.


50	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	50

Jordan pitches the client, his voice lowered.

JORDAN
Believe me, sir, you will not be sorry.


51	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT	51

Jordan stands before the Brokers.

JORDAN
Then you wait. Whoever speaks first loses. At this point, where are we in the sale? Chester?

CHESTER MING About to close?

JORDAN
No, you sweet and sour douchebag! We’re at the beginning of the beginning! This is where the sale starts. You as a salesman are almost hoping he says no so you can finally do your fucking job!


52	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	52

Jordan sits at the phone, waiting for a response.

CLIENT (O.S.)
I don’t know, I don’t think so.


53	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT	53

Jordan stands before the Brokers.

JORDAN
He doesn’t know, he needs to think, he’s gotta ask his wife! The fact is it doesn’t matter what the fuck he says! If he’s already agreed that the stock’s going up, then the only real objection he has at this point is he doesn’t trust you! And he shouldn’t trust you, you’re a fucking salesman! So what do you say?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	25.


54	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	54

Donnie talks on the phone to a Client.

DONNIE
Let me ask you this, sir -- had I been your broker for the past three to four years and made you money on a consistent basis, you probably wouldn’t say you need to think about it, you’d probably say pick me up three or four thousand shares, am I right?

CLIENT #2 (O.S.) Maybe.


55	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	55 (APR ‘90)

The place is crowded; now 20 Brokers make up the sales force. Sea Otter pitches a client.

SEA OTTER
Wait a second. You mean to tell me if I put you in Union Carbide at 7 and took you out at 32--


56	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	56 (MAY ‘90)

Even more crowded, with 30 Brokers.

ROBBIE FEINBERG
If I put you in Texas Instruments at 11 and took you out at 47--

More Brokers still - now there’s 45.

CHESTER MING
--Walmart at 16 and took you out at 95, you wouldn’t say Chester pick me up 10,000 shares? C’mon.

CLIENT #3 (O.S.) Well yeah, in that case I would.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	26.


58	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT II - BULLPEN - DAY (NOV ‘90)	58

New offices now, a real brokerage firm. The bullpen is large, with 75 Brokers at polished maple desks, sitting before computers talking into headsets.

4PM the place goes nuts as Jordan emerges from his office * holding a spread sheet. He addresses the crowd of 100 BROKERS, which now includes a dozen WOMEN.

JORDAN Everybody have a good week?

Applause; war whoops.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	28.


JORDAN (CONT’D) I’d like to read you something.
(reads spread sheet) Month end, March 1991! $28.7
million in gross commissions - all	* in Stratton issues. Not bad for	* penny stocks, huh boys? Not bad	* for dumpin’ penny stocks.	*

The place goes WILD with applause.

JORDAN (CONT’D)
And to celebrate with a weekly act of debauchery, I have offered our lovely sales assistant Danielle
Harrison ten thousand dollars to	* have her head shaved!

Jordan motions to DANIELLE HARRISON, 19, pretty, sitting	* in a chair nearby. Behind her, Rugrat uses clippers to
shave her thick brown mane. The place goes nuts.

JORDAN (CONT’D) FYI, Danielle tells me she’s using the money for breast implants! Is this a great company or what?!!

More wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen to Donnie. We hear the opening strains of “Stars & Stripes Forever” as he opens the door to a

COLLEGE MARCHING BAND

dressed in underwear and hats. The music continues as somersaulting GYMNASTS and BATON-TWIRLERS bring up the rear. As they march through the bullpen to cheers--

FROM THE KITCHEN -- two dozen TUXEDO-CLAD WAITERS emerge carrying trays of champagne and hors d’oeuvres. The music continues as two dozen STRIPPERS bolt in, gyrating among the BROKERS. As Jordan surveys the insanity:

JORDAN (V.O.) Word spread throughout Wall
Street -- I was becoming a legend. Forbes Magazine even called to do a profile on me...

JORDAN (V.O.) A total fucking hatchet job.


69	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING	69 (OCT ‘91)

A gorgeous place; city views. As Teresa sits nearby, a distraught Jordan paces, holding the copy of Forbes.

JORDAN
That conniving little twat! (reading)
“The Wolf of Wall Street”.

TERESA
(on the bright side) Your hair looks good.

JORDAN
“Jordan Belfort, a twisted version of Robin Hood who takes from the rich and gives to himself and his merry band of brokers”.

TERESA There’s no such thing as bad publicity, sweetie.


70	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT II - BULLPEN - LATER THAT DAY	70

Bustling with activity. Jordan enters, crosses toward his office. Off to the side of the bullpen, he notices three dozen YOUNG MEN in business suits. He approaches his assistant JANET, 20s, dressed all in black.

JORDAN The hell’s all this?

JANET
The Forbes article. They’re applying for jobs.

They spot Jordan, start clamoring, waving their resumes.

JOB APPLICANTS Mr. Belfort! Over here! Sir!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	30.


JORDAN (V.O.) Forbes had made me a superstar. Every day dozens of money-crazed kids beat a path to my door with resumes they hadn’t even bothered to spellcheck.

Jordan crosses through the packed bullpen, where 150 BROKERS, no older than 22, are crammed elbow to elbow talking into phones. Some have pets, which they tend to while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a chimp. Others are getting shoulder rubs by Masseuses or being fitted for suits by a TAILOR. Over the above:

JORDAN (V.O.)
If we hired ‘em, they dropped out of college overnight and blew whatever allowance they had on a new suit from our in-house tailor. The median age of our brokerage couldn’t get served in the bar down the street.


71	INT. FBI BREAK ROOM - DAY (OCT ‘91)	71

PATRICK DENHAM sits sipping coffee as he reads Forbes.

JORDAN (V.O.) Not this guy though -- what the fuck is he even doing here? He
read the Forbes article, too, but he already had a job.


72	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - DAY (MAR ‘92)	72

CLOSE ON two BROKERS wrestling while others cheer them on. PULL BACK to reveal the place from the opening. 300 young Brokers and their hot ASSISTANTS work the phones.

JORDAN (V.O.) Within months, we doubled in size, moved to even bigger offices.

Two other Brokers pump themselves up, chest-bumping and screaming like football players.

JORDAN (V.O.)
It was a madhouse, a greed-fest, with equal parts cocaine, testosterone and body fluids.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	31.


73	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - MEN’S ROOM - DAY (MAR ‘92)	73

In a stall, two Brokers snort coke, while another Broker fucks a Sales Assistant perched on the sink.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I had to declare the office a fuck-free zone between the hours of 9 and 7, but even that didn’t help.

Taped to the mirror we see a MEMO -- inside a red circle, two anatomically correct stick figures fuck doggy-style, a red line slashing through them.

JORDAN (V.O.) Actually the madness started on our very first day, when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner, christened the elevator by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant.


74	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - LOBBY - DAY (JAN ‘92)	74

Two dozen Brokers cheer, watching through the rising glass elevator as BEN JENNER, 25, gets a blowjob from a
brunette SALES ASSISTANT.	*

JORDAN (V.O.) Her name was Pam and to her credit, she did have an amazing technique, with this wild twist and jerk motion.


75	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	75 (FEB ‘92)

JORDAN (V.O.) Eventually Ben married her, which was pretty amazing considering she blew every guy in the office.

MAX BELFORT sits smoking, watching a rerun of “The Equalizer” on TV. His wife, LEAH, does needlepoint.

JORDAN (V.O.)
We called him Mad Max because of his hair-trigger temper, which could be set off by something as innocuous as a ringing telephone.

The phone RINGS.

MAX
Who the hell has the goddamn gall to call this house on a Tuesday evening! Goddammit!

JORDAN (V.O.)
But then the weirdest thing would happen. Though he’d never been near England, he’d pick up the phone and affect an ever-so-slight British accent.

Greatly agitated, Max stomps toward the phone.

JORDAN (V.O.)
This was his other persona -- the super polite, ever-gracious Sir Max.

MAX (into phone)
Hello?... Yes, Gene, right-eo. Good-good then... Cheerio.

JORDAN (V.O.)
It was absolutely bizarre. He’d hang up...

MAX (hangs up phone)
Goddamn fucking halfwit!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	33.

And become Mad Max all over again.

Max curses a blue streak as he stomps back to his chair.

JORDAN What if he gets hurt?

ROBBIE	* He’ll be wearing a helmet. Plus
they’ve got, like, superhuman strength anyway.

DONNIE	* I did hear you're not supposed to	* make direct eye contact. If you	* look at them too long in their	* eyes they get freaked out - their	* wires cross.	*

JORDAN	* I think there’s a limit to how far	* we can go... I mean we can throw	* shit at him and -	*

DONNIE	* They have a lot of feelings.	*

JORDAN	* There’s a specific thing that	* they’ll do - You can throw him at	* a dart board but if you want him	* to show his cock or -	*

ROBBIE	* Yes, that’s what this guy does.	*

RUGRAT	* That’s his gift.	*

ROBBIE	* Can we also bowl with him?	*

RUGRAT	* His brother is actually the	* bowler.	*

ROBBIE	* They strap a skateboard to him and	* throw him down an alley.	*

RUGRAT	* They’re ornery, too, the little

JORDAN Get some tranq darts.

DONNIE
A little straitjacket.	*

JORDAN	* What’s the liability on something	* like this?

RUGRAT	* That's a whole different thing. I	* can get on the phone with some	* people. I can talk to the	* insurance company and tell them	* exactly what we're going to do.	* But I think we go back to the same	* plan - loophole - if we don't	* really consider them people I	* think we are in the clear.	*

DONNIE	* I think we should keep one in the	* office because I think they’re	* good luck.	*

JORDAN	* Treat it like the fuckin' thing it	* is. He's coming in. We're paying	* him for something. Treat him with	* respect. And you just shake his	* hand like you don't even think	* anything's wrong.	*

DONNIE	* You just look like something else	* is going on.	*

RUGRAT	* You don’t look at his eyes.	*

DONNIE	* Say “thank you for being here”.	*

ROBBIE	* You don’t turn your back on him.	* It’s a sign of disrespect.	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	35.


DONNIE	* If you want a cracker or something	* - I’m gonna have some treats in my	* pocket. I want to be in a strip	* club with you guys. Literally pull	* out a brief case and have a little	* fuckin' guy pop out of there. You	* know how much fuckin' pussy you	* get?	*

DONNIE	* Get the jokes out now. Get the	* fuckin’ jokes out now.	*

JORDAN	* You’re gonna fuck it up. Purge all	* this shit right now.	*

DONNIE	* That’s what I’m saying -	*

JORDAN	* When he comes in the room, I want	* him to feel like a human being -	*

The guys straighten up and head to desk, settle in. Max	* blows in past her, waving a 3-inch-thick bill:

MAX
$430,000 dollars in one month!! Four-hundred-and-thirty-thousand dollars in one month!!

JORDAN
Hello, Father.	* (Max’s expression
doesn’t budge)
They’re business expenses. Just	* relax.	*

The guys titter at “business expenses.”

MAX
If you bastards don't wipe those smug fucking looks off your faces, I swear to God I'm gonna wipe ‘em off for you!
(back to Jordan) Are you insane?

ROBBIE	* Actually, Max, my portion of the
bill is hardly anything, so I’m on the same page as you --

MAX
Shut the fuck up, Feinberg, you only have a portion because of my son, you worthless twerp!

DONNIE (chuckles)
Twerp.

MAX
You zip it, too, Azoff, those boiling teeth of yours are hurting my fucking eyes!
(turning to Jordan)
My own son! From my very loins!

You don't think there's any end in sight, do you? It's all one giant party to you schmendricks!

MAX (CONT'D) (holds up AMEX bill)
$26,000 for one dinner!!

JORDAN Donnie ordered sides.

DONNIE Yeah, that was... Sorry.

MAX (glowering)
What is EJ Entertainment? What is EJ Entertainment?!

JORDAN (restraining a grin)
You tell me, Dad.

MAX
It’s a goddamn prostitution ring is what it is!!

Jordan feigns shock, turns to Donnie: did you know it was a prostitution ring?!

DONNIE
Doesn’t the IRS allow for T&A?

MAX
It’s T&E and stop fucking with me! What kind of hookers take credit cards, anyway?!

Jordan takes the bill, starts flipping through it.

JORDAN (V.O.)
In Stratton parlance, there were three kinds of hookers. There were blue chips, the top of the line. Model material. They were priced between $300 and $500 and made you wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip, which I always did.


77A	A “BLUE CHIP” HOOKER FLOATS THROUGH, SURROUNDED BY	*77A STRATTON BROKERS.	*

JORDAN (V.O.) Then came NASDAQs, who were pretty, but not great, usually in the two to three hundred dollar range.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	38.


77B	A “NASDAQ” HOOKER DANCES THROUGH BULLPEN. STRATTON	*77B BROKERS WATCH.	*

JORDAN (V.O.) Finally there were pink sheets, skanks, the bottom of the barrel.


77C	A “PINK SHEET” HOOKER, COVERED IN TATTOOS, IS ON ALL	*77C FOURS AS SEA OTTER RIDES HER LIKE A PONY.	*

JORDAN (V.O.) They usually cost a hundred or less, and if you didn't wear a condom, you'd get a penicillin shot the next day and pray your dick didn't fall off.


77D	THE ABOVE-MENTIONED “PINK SHEET” HOOKER SITS ON A STOOL,	*77D AS SEA OTTER FUCKS HER.	*

JORDAN (V.O.)
Not that we didn’t fuck them, too. Believe me, we did.

Behind him, the other guys wait their turns.	*

77E	BACK TO SCENE	77E

Max continues to steam so Jordan ushers Robbie, Rugrat and Donnie out the door.

JORDAN
Give us a minute, will you, guys?

He closes the door, then stretches a bit, exaggeratedly, letting out a little moan.

MAX What’s the matter?

JORDAN
Nothing, just... My back’s been killing me. Pain shooting down my leg. Not to worry, it’ll pass.

MAX
What do the doctors say?

JORDAN
Doctors, what do they know? I’m on like twenty different medications.
(re: the Amex bill)
Look, I know it's hard for you to make sense of these expenses, but
there's a method here, okay?	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	39.


Max waits to hear it; Jordan gestures to the bullpen	*

MAX
And you have to lead by example, is that it?
(Jordan nods)
I’m tellin’ ya, kid, one of these days... one of these days the
chickens are gonna come home to	* roost.

JORDAN	* In order to keep these guys	* working, I gotta keep ‘em	* spending. I need to keep them	* chasing the dream. You flash some	* cash, they do the same. It keeps	* them motivated.	*

MAX	* Pissing away money? That’s what	* motivates you kids?	*

JORDAN	* I could afford to pay them more,	* but then they wouldn't need me as	* much. And as long as they need me	* they'll always fear me. I know it	* sounds crazy.	*

MAX	* Crazy? This... is obscene.	*

He turns and exits. Jordan watches him go, thinking.

JORDAN (V.O.)
It was obscene -- in the normal world. But who wanted to live there?


78	EXT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - DAY (JUN ‘92)	78

Massive, with an Olympic-size pool overlooking the beach. Dozens of luxury cars parked outside. On a balcony, Jordan is mid-speech, in a bathing suit, addressing the Strattonites below, Teresa at his side.

JORDAN (O.C.)
-- so enjoy yourselves, you all deserve a celebration. ‘Cept for
Kimmie, she’s lazy and she steals.	* (off laughter, Kimmie	*
flips him the bird; he blows her a kiss)
But, everybody, keep this in mind.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	40.

JORDAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) As my friend Donnie Azoff says,
“If you wanna party with the boys, you gotta wake up with the men.” Monday morning I want you all looking razor-sharp. Cuz Stratton’s got a few things on the horizon, things that’re gonna take it right up into the fucking stratosphere!

The Crowd goes nuts. One Broker lets loose a wolf-howl, and the crowd toasts Jordan, chanting his name.

CROWD
Jor-dan! Jor-dan! Jor-dan!

As Jordan looks down smiling like a benevolent dictator --

JORDAN (PRE-LAP) Fuck Merrill Lynch, this way we become the underwriters.

ROBBIE (PRE-LAP)	* Like an investment bank.


79	INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - (LATER THAT) DAY	79

GORGEOUS PEOPLE dance/drink/snort coke. Upstairs, Jordan plays pool with Sea Otter, Donnie, Robbie, Toby and Rugrat, assigning ludes with every pocketed ball.

JORDAN
Exactly. We do our own IPO’s and we will print money.

SEA OTTER
Eat like a bird, shit like an elephant, baby!

JORDAN
They can take their Harvard asses under our desks and suck our cocks.
(to Rugrat)
How soon can you get the paperwork filed?

RUGRAT (super-stoned)
Can’t we talk about this Monday?

JORDAN
It’s a simple fucking question.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	41.


RUGRAT
Except I’m looking at three of you right now.

ROBBIE	* We’ve got Arncliffe National,
they’re looking to go public, we’ve got --

DONNIE (very luded)
Oh, oh, Steve... Steve...

JORDAN What?

DONNIE ...Steve... M-m-madden...

Donnie gesticulates wildly. The guys crack up. WE PUSH IN ON Donnie, practically drooling, as Jordan gives us a quick tutorial on ludes...

79A	QUAALUDE TUTORIAL	*79A

CUT TO: Extreme close up of guys doing drugs.	*

JORDAN (V.O.)
The quaalude was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor --that’s dot Indian, not feathers --as a sedative, and was prescribed to stressed housewives with sleep disorders. Pretty soon someone figured out that if you resisted the urge to sleep for fifteen minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass high from it. Didn’t take long for people to start abusing ludes, ‘course, and in 1982 the U.S. Government Schedule One’d them, along with the rest of the world. Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left. No shit, you can’t even find ‘em anymore today. You people’re all shit outta luck.



79B	BACK TO SCENE	*79B

JORDAN (to Donnie)
What’re you saying, buddy? (to the others)
Shhhh... listen to him...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	42.


DONNIE Ssshhhhoes... shhhoooess...

Jordan suspects Donnie may actually be onto something. But just then...

SEA OTTER Holy fuck.

Jordan peers over the balcony where Sea Otter’s looking.

NAOMI LAPAGLIA. 22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered the party with her date BLAIR. She smiles, full lips parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts.

RUGRAT
My nutsack’s about to explode.

ROBBIE	* Someone’s gotta take that down.

There’s no debate who that someone should be. Eyes locked on Naomi, Jordan makes his way downstairs.

WITH NAOMI taking in the party, her eyes flitting to things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.

NAOMI (V.O.)
A lotta people would look at me and think: “golddigger, she’s out to land the richest husband she can.” But you see, I came from nothing. Like, below the poverty line. And when you come from nothing, being rich means never having to go back to that.

Jordan approaches CRISTY, 20s, one of his guests.

CRISTY Jordan, hey.
(he smiles; Cristy picks up his intent)
Have you met my friend Naomi?

Jordan takes Naomi’s hand, doesn’t let go.

JORDAN Naomi.

NAOMI
You have an awesome house. I don’t think I’ve ever been in a house like this.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	43.


JORDAN
You like it? I just got it. I guess it’s okay. Six bedrooms, two hot-tubs, one off the master suite overlooking the water. You like to jet-ski?

Naomi’s date Blair offers his hand to break them apart. Toby Welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye.

BLAIR
Hi. Blair Hollingsworth.

Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi.

Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa. Her eyes stray to Jordan chatting up Naomi. Teresa’s eyes follow hers and sees them. Ouch. Hildy goes.

JORDAN
You’re telling me you’ve never jet-ski’ed in your life?!

NAOMI Never.

BLAIR
Y’know, we really should hit it, there’s two other parties we’re s’posed to get to --

JORDAN
What? You just got here. Stay.

Naomi looks like she’d like to. Hildy approaches, introduces herself, then:

HILDY
Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

JORDAN With what?

HILDY
I dunno, you’ll have to ask your wife what she wants.

Jordan sees: Teresa is watching from afar.

DONNIE(O.S.) Oh sweet Jesus!

Jordan turns to see a drunk Donnie, cock in hand, jerking off to Naomi. Hildy comes running over.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	44.



Donnie! doing?!
HILDY
What the fuck are you

During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party --

JORDAN (V.O.)
The day I met Naomi was the day I truly became the Wolf. Every guy wanted her -- so I had to have her.

-- Jordan watches her go. Naomi shoots a glance back to him and, like that, he’s hooked.


80	SCENES 80 - 81 OMITTED	80


82	INT. SIGN OF THE DOVE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT (JUN ‘92)	82

Romantic; elegant. Over a bottle of ‘53 Lafite, Jordan sits in mid conversation with Naomi, who is stunning in a low-cut black cocktail dress.


Bay Ridge. Island?
JORDAN
That’s near Staten

NAOMI
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge. Guinea gulch. Ever been?

JORDAN You’re Italian?

NAOMI
My dad’s side. Also Dutch, German, English -- I’m a mutt. Actually I have family over there, in London. My Aunt Emma.

JORDAN That explains it then.

NAOMI What?

JORDAN (smiles)
You’re a Duchess. The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

Naomi smiles, flags a passing WAITER.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	45.


NAOMI
Could I have a straw please?

The Waiter nods, heads off. A few beats, then:

NAOMI (CONT’D) So I was a little surprised you asked Cristy for my number.

JORDAN How come?

NAOMI Aren’t you married?

JORDAN
Married people can’t have friends?

Naomi smiles. The Waiter brings the straw. She opens it, slips it in her red wine glass. Off Jordan’s look:

NAOMI
So I don’t stain my teeth.

And as she sips the wine seductively through the straw...


83	EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT	83

Jordan’s Ferrari makes its way over the bridge, heading back toward Brooklyn.

NAOMI (O.S.)
--then at night I do my designs.


84	INT. JORDAN’S FERRARI - CONTINUOUS	84

Jordan drives, Naomi next to him.

NAOMI
An entire line of lingerie --camisoles, bustiers, panties.

Jordan glances over -- her dress is riding up her thigh.

JORDAN (V.O.) She designs panties?! Jesus fucking Christ!

Naomi smiles.

JORDAN
Sounds like something I might invest in. Venture capital.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	46.


NAOMI
Well we should definitely keep in touch, then.

JORDAN Absolutely.

He pulls over outside her brownstone.

NAOMI That’s me.

JORDAN (V.O.) Think, Jordan, think! How can you get up to her apartment?!

They look at each other. We can almost hear Jordan’s heart pounding.

NAOMI
You wanna come up for some tea?


85	INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT	85

A small, cozy apartment. Naomi enters, Jordan close behind. She picks up Rocky, her yapping Maltese.

NAOMI Say hi, Rocky.

Naomi waves Rocky’s paw. Jordan smiles.

NAOMI (CONT’D)
Why don’t you light a fire? I’ll be right out.

Jordan nods, takes in her scent as she walks away.

JORDAN (V.O.) God, please help me. How can I fuck this girl?

As he crouches by the fireplace, his skypager vibrates. He checks the readout: “Teresa”. His face falls as he hits the “silent” button, mind racing with guilt.

JORDAN (V.O.) That’s it, you’re leaving. You’re going home to your wife.

Jordan stands, turns around -- NAOMI is in the doorway, naked except for high heels.

JORDAN (V.O.) As you can probably guess, I fucked her goddamn brains out.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	47.


86	INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT	86

Rocky yaps incessantly as Jordan pounds away atop Naomi.

JORDAN (V.O.) For eleven seconds.

Jordan cums loudly, convulsively.

JORDAN I’m sorry, I--

NAOMI Did you cum?

JORDAN (nods; gasping)
Yeah, but I’m still hard.

Jordan looks down at her.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) Being inside her... was like your cock went to heaven and God
himself was cupping your balls.

And as they start fucking again...


87	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	87 (JUN ‘92)

Jordan sits at his desk, telephone to his ear.

JORDAN (V.O.) I couldn’t get enough.


88	INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - DAY (JUN ‘92)	88

CLOSE ON Naomi, who talks on the phone, smiling. We PULL BACK to see the apartment is packed with flowers.

JORDAN (V.O.) Every chance we got, we’d sneak off together...


89	INT. LIMOSINE - NIGHT (AUG ‘92)	89

Giggling like a child, Jordan pours coke from a vial, creating a little mound atop one of Naomi’s breasts.

JORDAN Hold still, don’t move.
(to the Driver) Watch the potholes!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	48.


More giggling, then he snorts the coke off her breast, burying his face in it as he climbs on top of her. Naomi laughs uncontrollably as the limo glides to a stop. The door opens from outside -- the Doorman?

TERESA (O.S.) Get out of the fucking car.

Jordan looks up, locks eyes with Teresa. He jumps off Naomi, stumbles out, closing the door behind himself.


90	EXT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS	90

JORDAN
What are you doing home?
TERESA
That whore from the party? How could you do this to me?!

The limo takes off. Teresa starts crying...

JORDAN
I thought you were at the beach house, I--

TERESA
I married you when you had nothing--

JORDAN Teresa... I don’t know what to say.

TERESA
You’re like a totally different person.

JORDAN
I’m not. I’m sorry. I made a mistake, okay?

TERESA
Tell me you don’t love her.

JORDAN I...

TERESA (off his silence)
Jordan?

Jordan says nothing. Finally, Teresa starts sobbing.

JORDAN (V.O.) I felt horrible.

Jordan holds her, letting her cry.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	49.


JORDAN (V.O.) Three days later I filed for divorce and moved Naomi into the apartment.


91	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - DUSK	91 (SEP ‘92)

Completely remodelled, all new furniture. Jordan and Naomi sit at the table, set for a candle-light dinner.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style. She brought in a decorator, feng shui’d the place--she even hired a gay butler.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER, 40s, enters with hot towels on a silver tray.

JORDAN Thank you, Nicholas.

Jordan takes a towel, wipes his face. Naomi smiles.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) He was smart, sophisticated,
really great. Except for that one time...


92	SCENES 92 - 94 OMITTED	*92


95	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT	*95

A GAY ORGY is in progress, a dozen naked MEN, including Nicholas, in various sexual positions about the room.

NAOMI Omigod!


96	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT	96

Jordan sits across from a very shaken Naomi.

NAOMI
He must have thought I was at my mother’s.

JORDAN
Where were they? In the bedroom?

NAOMI They were right here!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	50.


A beat, then Jordan realizes. He jumps off the couch like it’s on fire.

NAOMI (CONT’D) It gets worse. After I chased
them out, I checked the apartment.

JORDAN (V.O.)
The motherfucker stole fifty grand in cash and jewelry.


97	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIBRARY - DAY	97 (OCT ‘92)

With Nicholas seated in a chair, Jordan sits across from him. Pacing behind him is Donnie, coked-up, face contorted, frothing with rage. Nearby, giant Chester Ming sits quietly, saying nothing.

JORDAN
I just want my stuff back, okay?

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER I didn’t take anything.

DONNIE (in his face)
I should kill you, cocksucker! You do not fuck with this man!

Jordan holds Donnie off. Turns back to Nicholas.

JORDAN
You were high, things got out of control, I get it. Believe me I do, I have a Phd in debauchery.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER I didn’t do it.

DONNIE
I’ll knock your fuckin’ teeth out, motherfucker!

JORDAN
Just give me the money, give me the jewelry, and we’ll forget the whole thing.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER It’s because I’m gay, isn’t it?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	51.


JORDAN
Nicholas. You could fuck a baby sheep as far as I care, on my brand new fucking sofa. What I won’t stand for is being robbed.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER I’m telling you the truth.

JORDAN
I’ll ask you one last time.

DONNIE
You’re dead, you piece of shit!

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER Jordan, please.

JORDAN Fine.

Jordan nods to Chester. Without a word, he crosses to Nicholas and BAMMM!! Nicholas’s nose splits open like a ripe plum, blood spurting everywhere. Tough-guy Donnie takes one look, then SPEWS vomit into a garbage pail. And as Chester pummels Nicholas’s face into chopped meat...

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) It’s amazing the kind of loyalty money will buy. I mean Chester almost killed this prick.

Chester starts to hang Nicholas over the balcony by his legs. Jordan stops him.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I finally called the cops, mainly to save Nicholas’s life.


98	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY	98

With the bloodied Nicholas in the background, Jordan talks to two NYPD COPS, handing them each a wad of cash.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I gave them each a thousand bucks and told them what Nicholas had done. Then they kicked his ass.

As the Cops swat Nicholas with their nightsticks:


COP #1 Fuckin’ thief, huh?
COP #2 Piece of shit.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	52.


And as they hustle Nicholas out...

JORDAN (V.O.) Loyalty, like I said. Which was the key component to my incredible fucking success.


98A	EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY (OCT ‘92)	98A

As Jordan golfs with Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Toby and	* some hookers, Brad pulls up in a golf cart with a cash-	* filled gym bag.

JORDAN (V.O.) Besides Brad, I had eight other ‘ratholes’, close friends who’d own stock on paper, but kick the profits back to me after I drove the price through the roof.

They hug, then Jordan adds the gym bag to several others on the back of his golf cart. Donnie tries to befriend Brad; Brad isn’t interested.

JORDAN (V.O.)
The SEC knew I was doing something shady, but they couldn’t figure out what the fuck it was.


99	SCENES 99 - 100 OMITTED	99


101	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - (ANOTHER) DAY	101

Jordan, Max and securities lawyer MANNY RISKIN exit the kitchen with coffees.

MANNY RISKIN I’m telling you -- piss on the
SEC’s leg, you’ll end up with your tits in a ringer.

FREEZE FRAME - Manny stuffs a cruller into his mouth.

JORDAN (V.O.) My securities attorney, Manny
Riskin. Seven hundred an hour to	* be the voice of doom.

BACK TO SCENE

JORDAN
It’s under control. Will you relax already?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	53.


Just then, Max spots a BROKER break-dancing as three other Brokers look on...

MAX
What the fuck is this imbecile doing?!

Max crosses off, starts screaming at the break-dancing Broker. Jordan keeps walking with Manny.

JORDAN (V.O.)
The SEC sent two lawyers down to review our files, so I set them up in our conference room.

Jordan passes the conference room, looks in the window--two SEC ATTORNEYS wear coats as they review documents.

JORDAN (V.O.) Then I had it bugged and the air conditioning locked till it felt like Antarctica in there.

One of the SEC Attorneys blows into his hands for warmth. Manny follows Jordan toward the bullpen, his frenzied Brokers working the phones.

JORDAN (V.O.)
So here they were, looking for a smoking gun while I was firing a bazooka right under their noses. It was our first IPO, and we were driving the stock price to the fucking moon.

BROKER #1 Arncliffe National, it’s on fire!

BROKER #2 (voice lowered)
Believe me, your grandkids will thank you.

BROKER #3 (to Sales Assistant)
Arncliffe National, ten thousand shares!

Jordan speaks directly to camera as he continues walking through the bullpen.

JORDAN
See an IPO is an initial public offering, the first time a stock is offered for sale to the general population.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	54.

JORDAN (CONT'D) As the firm taking the company public, we set the initial price,
then sold those shares back to --	* (stops; then)
You know what, you’re probably not	* following what I’m saying. The	* question is, “was it legal?”	* Absolutely not. But we were making	* more money that we knew what to do	* with.	*

102A	EXT. BANK - DAY - ESTABLISHING (OCT ‘92)	1*02A


103	INT. BANK - SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT - DAY (OCT ‘92)	103

Alone in a private room, Jordan unloads a small suitcase filled with stacks and stacks of hundred dollar bills.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But I figured it out.	*

CLOSE ON - a huge diamond engagement ring.

NAOMI (O.C.) Omigod!!


104	INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - NIGHT (OCT ‘92)	104

Jordan is down on one knee, proposing; Naomi hyperventilates as he puts the ring on her finger -- a seven carat, yellow canary diamond in a platinum setting.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I held my bachelor party at the
Tangiers in Las Vegas -- one last	* blowout for the Gods before I
settled down for good.


105	SCENE 105 OMITTED	105


106	INT. TRANS CAPITAL AIRLINES - JUMBO JET - NIGHT	*106

Inside a jumbo jet, a wild, mid-air party is in progress.

JORDAN (V.O.)
A hundred Strattonites flew in with fifty hookers and enough drugs to open a pharmacy.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	55.


Various images -- Stratton Brokers drink, do coke, a half-dozen in mid-orgy with Hookers, naked in the aisle as others pour champagne on them.

JORDAN (V.O.) All told, the weekend cost me almost two million dollars--


107	PERIOD VEGAS ADS	*107


108	INT. TANGIERS - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY	*108

The Tangiers Presidential Suite is a shambles on the	* level of Hiroshima. A giant crystal chandelier lays shattered on the floor; Jordan asleep in the massive bed,
a Blue Chip Hooker on either side of him; other passed-out BODIES lay amid debris and broken, toppled furniture.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But the wedding was like something out of a fairy tale--


109	EXT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - SUNSET (DEC ‘92)	109

Gorgeous; tropical. Hundreds of FAMILY and FRIENDS (Janet, Toby Welch, Peter DeBlasio and Kimmie Belzer) look on as Jordan and Naomi walk up the aisle.

JORDAN (V.O.)
--with Naomi my Duchess, me her handsome Duke and The Bahamas Ocean Club our castle.


110	INT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - BALLROOM - NIGHT	110

Jordan and Naomi waltz, their Guests joining in.

JORDAN (V.O.) Of course after that bachelor party, the Duke needed a few penicillin shots so he could
safely consummate the marriage.


111	INT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - BALLROOM - LATER	111

As Jordan and Naomi mingle with a few Strattonites, videographer BARRY KLEINMAN, 40s, approaches Rugrat and his DATE, ABBY with a video camera:
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	56.


BARRY KLEINMAN I’m Barry Kleinman, filming the wedding -- would you like to say something to Jordan and Naomi?

RUGRAT / ABBY Good luck! We love you!

Across the way, Naomi spots someone through the crowd--

NAOMI Omigod! Aunt Emma!

Naomi rushes over, hugs her AUNT EMMA, 50s, demure, British. Naomi turns, calls out to Jordan, who is now in a huddle with the guys, his back to her.

NAOMI (CONT’D) Jordan! Look!

Jordan turns, then crosses to them, smiling.

AUNT EMMA Jordan dear, how lovely.

JORDAN
It’s so nice to see you again.

As he leans in to hug her, Aunt Emma spots some white powder on the edge of Jordan’s nostril. Deftly, she wipes it off, smiling.

AUNT EMMA Into the donuts, I see.

JORDAN Oh, I’m--- uh...

Aunt Emma leans in to his ear.

AUNT EMMA
I lived through the 60s, my dear. Enjoy the day.

And with that, she turns back to Naomi.


112	EXT. BAHAMAS - MARINA - DAY (DEC ‘92)	112

With Naomi wearing a blindfold, Jordan leads her to the end of a long dock, expensive yachts moored everywhere.

JORDAN Careful now. You ready?

Jordan removes her blindfold -- there, towering above the others, is a stunning, 120 foot yacht.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	57.


NAOMI What is this?

JORDAN
Your wedding present. Check out the name.

She does; it’s called “Naomi”. As she squeals, hugs him-

JORDAN (V.O.) For three weeks we sailed the Naomi through the Caribbean--


113	INT. YACHT NAOMI - DAY (DEC ‘92)	113

The camera PUSHES IN past a white-jacketed STEWARD,
who opens the door to the yacht’s main salon; next we see the living room, with its full bar and leather couches; then the bedroom, with a king bed and monogrammed sheets.

JORDAN (V.O.)
--eventually taking her home to Long Island, where we’d bought a house.


114	EXT. CARIBBEAN - OPEN OCEAN - DAY (DEC ‘92 - JAN ‘93)	114

115L	WE SEE the household STAFF lined up outside the house.	115L

116	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	116

Amid billowing piles of white Chinese silk, Jordan sleeps on his back, snoring blissfully.

JORDAN (V.O.) It was heaven on earth.

On screen WE SEE:

18 MONTHS LATER

Splash! A glass of water hits him in the face.

NAOMI
Wake up, you bag of shit!

Soaking wet, Jordan sits upright to see Naomi standing over him in a tiny pink chemise, holding an empty glass.

JORDAN The fuck are you doing?!

NAOMI Who’s Venice?

JORDAN What?!

NAOMI
Who is she?! Some little hooker you fucked last night?

JORDAN What? No! Naomi!

And as Naomi storms off for a re-fill...

Jordan lies on the ground, hands tied with a lit candle	* up his ass.	*

NAOMI
You were calling her name in your sleep!

JORDAN
I can explain everything.

NAOMI
Go ahead. More lies from the man who lies for a living!

JORDAN
No, really. Donnie and me, we’re investing in a condo development in Venice.

NAOMI Italy?!

JORDAN California, baby.

NAOMI Yeah, right.

JORDAN Duchess, come on.

NAOMI
Don’t ‘Duchess’ me, you scumbag. You think I don’t know what you’re up to? You’re a father now and you act like an infant!

Splash! She nails him again, crosses for more water.

JORDAN
Fuck. Naomi! Why are you so mad?

NAOMI
Where do you want me to start? How about you flying in here on your stupid helicopter at three in the morning waking up Skylar?!


119	EXT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - YARD - NIGHT (FEB ‘95)	119

Jordan crash-lands the helicopter on the driving range.	* He exits, gives Captain Dave a salute, fights his way	* through the bushes, then stumbles toward the house and	* falls into the pool, stoned out of his skull. Security	* floodlights come on and the alarm sounds.	*

NAOMI (O.S.)
Does it even matter to you that I just had that driving range sodded with Bermuda grass?


120	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	120

Back to scene. Naomi holds another glass of water.

NAOMI
But why should you give a shit? You're not the one who researched the fucking thing and dealt with the fucking golf course people!

JORDAN
You’re an aspiring landscape architect?! But what happened to wine connoisseur? Oh wait, that was last month!

NAOMI Fuck you!

Naomi winds up with the water glass. Jordan stands tall, puffs himself up, arms flexed at his sides.

NAOMI (CONT’D) Stop flexing your arms, you look like a fucking imbecile.
(re: his crotch)
And don’t think that impresses me much.

Jordan looks down: he has a morning erection.

JORDAN
I wasn't flexing my arms. You're just lucky to have a husband who's in such great shape. Now get over here and kiss me!

NAOMI Kiss you?!

Splash! She nails him one last time, then storms out. He stands there dripping wet. To his erection:

JORDAN
Where the fuck were you last night?

JORDAN (V.O.)
My morning ritual. First I’d get up and fight with Naomi about whatever I did the night before.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	61.


120A	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - STEAM SHOWER - DAY	120A

Jordan stands in the steaming shower.

JORDAN (V.O.) Next it was a steam so I could sweat out whatever drugs were still in my system.


120B	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS	120B

Jordan looks at himself in the mirror. His eyes are bloodshot - he looks like shit.

JORDAN (V.O.) After that I’d assess the damage.

Jordan looks at a Visine bottle - “Recommended Dosage -Two Drops”. He squirts six drops in each eye.

JORDAN (V.O.) What kind of maniac abuses eye drops?


121	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	121

Fully dressed and standing amid hundreds of suits, Jordan pops two white pills, swigs some juice.

JORDAN (V.O.) Then I’d get dressed, take my “back pills” to get me started,
then attempt to make up with her.


122	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - SKYLAR’S ROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	122

Jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland. On the fluffy pink carpet is Naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her hips, Manolo Blahniks showing polished red toes. Between her legs sits SKYLAR, their 5-month-old daughter.

JORDAN Hey, Skylar.

NAOMI (little girl voice)
Good morning Daddy. Where’s my kiss?

Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	62.


JORDAN (playing along)
Does Daddy get to kiss both his girls?

NAOMI
Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy for a very, very long time.

Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she’s wearing no panties. The wind goes out of Jordan.

JORDAN
C’mon, Nay, please. You know how sorry I am. I swear I--

NAOMI (cutting him off)
Daddy shouldn’t waste his time. And from now on it's going to be nothing but short, short skirts around the house! And Mommy’s so sick and tired of wearing panties, uhhh. In fact she’s decided to throw them all away.
(parting her thighs)
So take a good look. You’ll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house, but no touching.

She licks her lips seductively. Jordan sets Skylar aside, starts grovelling.

NAOMI (CONT’D) What’s wrong, Daddy?

Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking it. Jordan can barely speak.

JORDAN
C’mon, why are you doing this? I said I’m sorry.

NAOMI (pouting)
Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to say how wrong he is when he’s ready to come in his own pants. Isn’t that right Dada? Mommy loves Daddy so, so much and there’s nothing she wants to do more right now than to make love to Daddy all day long. Well, I guess it’s time for Daddy to be taught his first lesson.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	63.


Naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her inner thigh, then up toward her vagina. Jordan watches transfixed, then a change comes over him...

JORDAN
I wouldn’t do that if I were you Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a story before she decides to please herself like that.
Can Daddy tell Mommy a story? (off her nod)
And does mommy promise to keep her legs spread wide, wide open the whole time?
(she nods dreamily)
Good. Once upon a time there was a great big mansion in Long Island and the people who lived there had lots and lots of money. But of all the possessions they had, there was one thing that was much more valuable than all the rest combined, and that was their little baby daughter.

Naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Now because he was very security-conscious, the Daddy hired two full-time guards, big hairy men both named Rocco, and they installed security cameras all around the house. And one of those cameras is right over Daddy's shoulder.

Naomi’s eyes widen -- she look toward a Teddy Bear on a shelf. WE SEE that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera.

JORDAN (CONT’D)
So smile, Mommy! You're on Candid Camera!


123	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - GUARD HOUSE - DAY (FEB ‘95)	123

Mesmerized, ROCCO DAY watches a video screen, on which we see a grainy image of Naomi, hand between her legs.


124	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - SKYLAR’S BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	124

Naomi jumps up as if she’s been electrocuted.

NAOMI You asshole!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	64.


As she bolts from the room, Jordan plays with Skylar...

JORDAN (V.O.)
The good thing about living with a world-class ballbreaker is they make all the other ballbreakers in your life a little easier to take.


125	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - OUTSIDE JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	125 (FEB ‘95)

Donnie stands talking with Jordan’s assistant, Janet. Jordan approaches under a head of steam.

DONNIE There he is.

JORDAN
(a quick hug; then) Steve here yet?

DONNIE
On his way. Very excited.

JORDAN
Good. Cuz we have a problem.

He indicates out to the Bullpen. Donnie and Janet look.

JANET (incredulous)
Is he wearing a bow tie?

In the Bullpen WE SEE a young Stratton Broker in a bowtie cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk.

JORDAN
He’s got nothing better to do on the day of the biggest IPO in this firm’s history?!

Jordan watches as Donnie marches toward the Broker in a bowtie...


126	INT. BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS	126

DONNIE The fuck you doing?

BROKER IN A BOWTIE (bewildered)
Cleaning my fishbowl.

DONNIE Oh.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	65.


Donnie nods, turns to go, but suddenly he turns back and thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming goldfish. The Broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified.

DONNIE(CONT’D) On new issue day?! On cocksucking, motherfucking new issue day?!

Dozen of Brokers and Sales Assistants look over as Donnie snatches up the fish. Holding it by its tail, he jumps	* up on the desk of the Broker in a bowtie. Now the entire Bullpen looks over.

DONNIE(CONT’D)
This is what happens when you fuck with your pets on new issue day!

With the flair of a showman, Donnie pops the fish in his mouth, swallowing it whole. The Brokers cheer wildly. Donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the Broker in a bowtie:

DONNIE(CONT’D) Now take your bowtie, get your shit and get the fuck out!

Bowtie is stunned. And as Donnie storms off, we PUSH IN on Jordan, watching from across the room.


127	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	127 (FEB ‘95)

Jordan finishes a phone call as Donnie enters with STEVE MADDEN, 30s, dressed in wrinkled navy blazer, cargo pants and T-shirt, a baseball cap over his scraggly, thinning hair. Jordan smiles, crosses to greet him.


The Cobbler.


Hey buddy.
JORDAN
Ready to get rich?

STEVE MADDEN

And as they ad lib greetings, settle in at the couch:

JORDAN (V.O.) Steve Madden, the shoe designer, was a childhood friend of Donnie’s, but I didn’t hold that against him. Remember those ads, those giant-headed girls with bug eyes wearing those big clunky shoes?

127A	INSERT - a quick series of Steve Madden ads.	127A
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	66.


JORDAN (V.O.)
He came to me a few years earlier when he was just starting out, so I became a silent partner in his company, buying an 85% stake for only a million bucks.


128	INT. STEVE MADDEN SHOES - DAY	128

WE SEE various stores, all packed with teenage GIRLS buying shoes and boots.

JORDAN (V.O.) The company blew up and we were
now taking it public. It was the biggest deal we’d ever done and the hottest IPO on Wall Street.


129	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	129 (FEB ‘95)

Jordan and Donnie sit with Steve Madden in mid-conversation.

DONNIE
--which is why they need to meet you.

JORDAN
You gotta get ‘em fired up so they’ll push the shit out of this stock.

DONNIE
Let them feel your passion.


130	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (FEB ‘95)	130

Bustling with activity. With Jordan and Donnie looking on from nearby, Steve Madden approaches a microphone on the raised platform, in his hands several shoe boxes.

STEVE MADDEN (into mic)
Uhhh... excuse me...

The place slowly comes to order.

STEVE MADDEN (CONT’D) For those of you who don't know
me, my name is Steve Madden. I'm --

ONE BROKER We know who you are!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	67.


Steve clears his throat, looks over at Jordan -- he’s terrified. Jordan motions for him to calm down.

STEVE MADDEN
I uh, I'd like to start by telling you about my background in the shoe industry.

ANOTHER BROKER Nice fucking hat!

STEVE MADDEN
I uh... first started working in the shoe industry, in a shoe store. When I was sixteen, my friends were out chasing girls, but I was learning about women's shoes.

KALIL Move the mike closer.
PETER DEBLASIO
We can’t fucking hear you!	*

He moves the mic; feedback SCREECHES through the bullpen.

STEVE MADDEN (CONT’D) Sorry... Anyway, my first job
was at a shoe store like I said where I worked in the stockroom. You know, I can honestly say I’ve been a lover of women's shoes since I was twelve--

BROKER #4 Freak!

STEVE MADDEN No. Heh-heh. Not like that.
I mean somehow I became fascinated with the endless design possibilities for women's shoes--


BROKER #5 Queer!
BROKER #6 Get a fucking life!

Boos, hisses. Steve looks at Jordan, who motions for him to speed up. He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes.

STEVE MADDEN (CONT’D) This shoe -- the Mary Lou -- is
the one that really put me on the map. It’s a black patent leather variation of the Mary Jane, but--

SPLAT! A half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steve’s feet. In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic--
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	68.


JORDAN
All right, let's hear it for Steve Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!

Huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Okay, now that you got that out of your system, I want you to know why Steve is so completely off the fucking wall... It’s because this man is a creative genius. Steve's power, his gift -- is that he creates trends. Artists like Steve come along once a century! Elvis! Andy Warhol! Giorgio Armani! Who knows how high this stock could go? The 20s? The 50s? The 80s?

Applause; war whoops. Jordan motions for quiet.

JORDAN (CONT’D) I want everybody to look down.
See that little black box in front of you? It's called a telephone. Now I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about this telephone -- it won't dial itself! That’s right -- until you take some action, it's nothing more than a worthless hunk of plastic, like a loaded M16 without a trained Marine to pull the trigger. And in the case of the telephone, it's the action of you, a highly trained Strattonite, a killer who will not take no for an answer! A person who will not hang up the phone until his client either buys or fucking dies!

The Brokers go crazy. Jordan looks around.

JORDAN (CONT’D)
I don't care if you graduated from Harvard or Bumfuck University or never got past fourth fucking grade! That phone is the great equalizer!
(pause; looks around) There is no nobility in poverty.
I've been rich, and I've been poor and I choose rich every time.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	69.

JORDAN (CONT’D) At least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show
up in the back of a limo wearing a $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch!

Jordan takes off his GOLD WATCH, flings it to the Crowd. Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball.

JORDAN (CONT’D) And if anyone here thinks I'm crazy, get the fuck out and get a job at McDonald’s, because that's where you fucking belong! But before you depart this room full of winners, I want you to take a good look at the person next to
you, because one day in the not-so-distant future, you'll be sitting at a red light in your beat-up old Pinto, and that person’s gonna pull up in a brand new Porsche, with their gorgeous young wife at their side. And who will you be next to? Some ugly beast with three days of razor-stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in next to you with a carload of groceries from the fucking Price Club!

He scans the Brokers; they’re on the edge of their seats.

JORDAN (CONT’D) So you listen to me and listen
carefully. Are you behind on your credit card bills? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Is your landlord threatening to evict you? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking loser? Pick up the phone and start fucking dialing! I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich! I want you to go out and spend money! Leverage yourself, back yourself into a corner, let the consequences of failure become so fucking unthinkable that you'll have no choice but to do whatever it takes to win!

The Brokers go absolutely APESHIT.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	70.


JORDAN (CONT’D) You have an obligation here,
people! To your clients! To this firm! An obligation to yourself, godammit! You ram Steve Madden stock down your clients’ throats and make them choke on it till they buy 20,000 shares! Be aggressive! Be ferocious! Be telephone fucking terrorists!!

Before Jordan is even finished, the Brokers GO BERSERK, some already dialing their phones.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) At 1 p.m. we opened the stock for sale at $4.50 a share. By 1:03
it was over eighteen dollars.


130A	INT. FBI OFFICES - MANHATTAN - DAY	130A

Agent Denham exits the elevator, arriving for work. He strides between cubicles, briefcase in hand. He enters --


130B	INT. AGENT DENHAM’S OFFICE - DAY	130B

-- where pinned up on one wall is a massive chart on Stratton’s operations: pictures of Jordan, Donnie and others, a hierarchy, a history, an investigation...


131	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - LATER (FEB ‘95)	131

Total sales frenzy. The CAMERA PANS the 300 Brokers, who work the phones like mad.

SEA OTTER
--the hottest new issue on Wall Street!
YOUNG BROKER
--up two dollars while I’m talking to you!

And as we continue PANNING the room...

JORDAN (V.O.) Of course I couldn’t have done
this without help. I’d leaked the word on Wall Street that Stratton was a buyer up until twenty. So not only were we pushing Madden, all the big firms were too.

We continue PANNING the frenzied Brokers...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	71.


JORDAN (V.O.)
As long as they knew I’d buy the shares back at the top of the market, they’d drive the price up as high as I fucking wanted.


132	SCENES 132 - 133 OMITTED	132


134	INT. JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY (FEB ‘95)	134

Donnie pours champagne nearby, oblivious to Jordan, who sits at his desk, speaking directly to camera:

JORDAN
Of the two million shares being offered for sale, a million belonged to me, held in phony accounts by my ratholes. Once the price hit the high teens, I--

Jordan abruptly stops. A beat, then:

JORDAN (CONT’D) Like I said before, who gives a shit? As always, the point is this--

BACK TO SCENE -- Donnie hands Jordan a glass of Dom.

DONNIE
22 million in three fucking hours!

They toast, then each pop ludes, which they wash down with champagne. A quick knock; Janet pops her head in.

JORDAN Janet, baby. Drink.


Call for you. Future Video?


Who?
JANET
Barry Kleinman from


JORDAN

JANET
He filmed your wedding. He says it’s urgent.

Curious, Jordan leans over, hits the speaker phone:

JORDAN Barry?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	72.


135	INT. FUTURE VIDEO - DAY (FEB ‘95)	135

Barry Kleinman sits at his desk, talking on the phone.

BARRY KLEINMAN Jordan, hey. Listen, I got a subpoena. The FBI wants a copy of your wedding video.

On Jordan. Uh-oh.

JORDAN (V.O.) The F-B-fucking-I?


135A	INT. FIRING RANGE - DAY	135A

Wearing goggles and protective headphones, square-jawed FBI Agent Patrick Denham takes target practice.

BO DIETL (V.O.) Name’s Denham, he’s an agent in the New York office.

JORDAN (V.O.) What’s his problem?

BO DIETL (V.O.) He’s a boy scout, thinks you’re Gordon Gekko.


135B	EXT. RAO’S - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING (MAR ‘95)	1*35B


136	INT. RAO’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT (MAR ‘95)	136

The East Harlem institution. Jordan sits across a table over pasta with private investigator BO DIETL, 40s.

JORDAN
But my goddamn wedding video?

BO DIETL
Got your whole inner circle in one place, faces and names. He’s hoping it rattles you, or maybe your wife, so that she starts nagging you to turn witness.

JORDAN (that’s laughable)
What? He wants me to rat on myself?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	73.


BO DIETL (shrugs)
Good news is I made some calls, DEA, Justice? No one but him even knows who you are.

JORDAN
Can you bug him or something, tap his phone?

BO DIETL Jordan, relax. First off, you
don’t fuck with these guys, not that way. Secondly, I got a P.I. license, you know?

JORDAN
Maybe I should call him, see what he wants.

BO DIETL
No! Anybody does that should be your lawyer. What you do is eat your dinner, drink your drink, and forget about it. Cuz as far as I hear he doesn’t have shit.

Jordan nods, wheels turning, pretending to do as told.

136A	SCENE 136A OMITTED	1*36A


137	EXT. BATTERY PARK MARINA - DAY (LATE SPRING ‘95)	137

As Agent Denham steps into frame, another FED, AGENT	* HUGHES, beside him, both G-man stoic in impenetrably dark * glasses --

JORDAN (O.S.) Patrick? Hey! C’mon aboard!

They look up. On the yacht Naomi, Jordan stands waving, drinking wine with two Blue Chip HOOKERS in bikinis.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Plank’s right down there.

Denham shares a look with his cohort: it’s almost a joke, this display of wealth before a federal agent. Moments later, they step aboard.

AGENT DENHAM Mr. Belfort, I’m Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	74.


JORDAN Heya! This is Nicole and,
um...Heidi. Girls, Patrick and...?

AGENT DENHAM Agents Denham and Hughes. Your message said you wanted to speak privately.

JORDAN It did. I do.
(off Denham’s stare) Oh, they’re just friends.
(to the girls) Give us a minute, okay?

The Hookers head below deck. Jordan shoots Denham a wink--check out that ass!

JORDAN (CONT’D) Can I get a glass? Got wine open or any kinda booze. Shrimp and lobster’re over there if you’re hungry.

AGENT DENHAM
Bureau forbids us from drinking at sea.

Jordan surprised: the guy has a sense of humor.

JORDAN
I have something for you, I just gotta find it. Have a seat, will ya? Ever been on one of these before?

As Jordan rifles through some papers, Denham’s eyes scan the deck, casually cataloguing everything.

AGENT DENHAM
A boat? Learned to sail when I was six.

JORDAN
I mean, one like this. Just had her extended to put a chopper on the back.

Jordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter.

AGENT DENHAM
Never been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of it.

Jordan finds the file he’s been looking for, offers it.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	75.


AGENT DENHAM (CONT’D) (before he’ll accept)
What is this?

JORDAN
Names and addresses of every guest at my wedding. Friends, clients. I even threw in the seating chart. Heard that’s why you wanted the video, figured this’d expedite whatever it is you’re doing.
(Denham looks: it’s indeed a guest list from the wedding)
I wanted to show you I’ve got nothing to hide. I know you’re investigating Stratton but for the life of me I can’t figure out why. Sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn’t? Maybe we’re a little louder than most but we don’t do anything illegal. Talk to the SEC, they’ll tell you, they checked us out up and down.

AGENT DENHAM The SEC’s actually a civil regulatory agency. We pursue criminal activity.

JORDAN
That’s what I’m saying. You guys take on real crime. Which is why I’m so curious: what do you think we did?

The reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes.

AGENT DENHAM I can’t discuss ongoing investigations.

JORDAN I understand.

AGENT DENHAM Though, to be frank, this case kinda got dumped on my desk. Some higher-up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press, fell on me to do the looking.

JORDAN
You know who you should be looking at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	76.

JORDAN (CONT'D) What those guys’re up to with collateralized debt obligations? This internet stock bullshit? C’mon. If you want, I’ll walk you through exactly --

AGENT DENHAM
-- that’d be great. And if there’s anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk--

JORDAN
-- sure, get you back to the real criminals --

AGENT DENHAM
-- then we could both profit from this little sit-down.

Jordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by “profit”?

JORDAN
You sure you don’t want anything to drink? Water for your pal?
(Denham demurs)
Rumor is your started out in finance. Even got your broker’s license before you joined the bureau.

AGENT DENHAM Who told you that?

JORDAN (searches his memory)
Jeez, who was it...? (comes up short)
Ever regret it? Giving up the money-crazed, pin-striped life? Ever think where you’d be if you’d stuck with it?

AGENT DENHAM
When I’m riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit I’ve worn three days, sure.

JORDAN
Whattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don’t mind me asking. 50-60K a year?

AGENT DENHAM
Just about. We get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn’t suck.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	77.


JORDAN
S’crazy, the world we live in, the jobs with real value, the ones we should appreciate -- firefighters, teachers, FBI agents -- those are the ones we pay the least.

AGENT DENHAM Way of the world.

JORDAN
That’s one thing I like about what I do, the opportunity to make that right. Take this kid we had interning last year. Didn’t want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third-rate care. Some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and --boom -- overnight everything changes, she’s seeing the best doctors in the country. Sadly, didn’t work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while.
(as Denham considers that)
See, it’s all about proper guidance, Pat. Knowing someone with the right relationships, who’s discreet. I can change a life almost every day.

They measure each other.

AGENT DENHAM
How much that intern make off your deal?

JORDAN North of half a million.

Denham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan:

AGENT DENHAM
Can you say that again, what you told me?
(Jordan declines with a smile; to Agent Hughes)
I believe Mr. Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	78.


JORDAN
What? I was making conversation.

AGENT DENHAM Sounds like that to me, Jordan.

JORDAN ...no, no, no...

AGENT DENHAM ...sounded like that...

JORDAN
...no, to constitute a bribe, don’t I have to make an explicit offer of money for services? With an exact dollar figure attached? All I said was “north” of half a million. According to the U.S. Criminal Code, that dog won’t hunt, Pat.
(then)
Heard you were a straight arrow. That you wouldn’t bend the rules other agents might. He was right.

AGENT DENHAM
You did a background check on me?

JORDAN
Figured you were looking into me, was only fair. Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part.

AGENT DENHAM
This is why you invited me down to your yacht? With a couple hookers on it --

JORDAN
-- those are friends --

AGENT DENHAM
-- to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you?

Jordan puts his hands up: “you got me.”

JORDAN
Thanks for coming down. Now get off my boat.

AGENT DENHAM
You know, most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust, they were born to the life.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	79.

AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D) Their father was a douchebag
before them, and his father before that. But you, you got this way all on your own. Good for you, Jordan.
(as he starts to go) Thank you for having us. I’m
absolutely certain we’ll see each other again.
(before he does)
You know, this is about the nicest boat I’ve ever been on. Just think what a hero I’ll be in the office when the bureau seizes it.

Jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can’t let Denham get the final word. He calls after them:

JORDAN
Hey, Denham! I’m gonna eat a claw of lobster now as I get my cock sucked by Heidi down below. You have a super ride home on the
subway thinking about that!	*

As he watches them pull away, seething --

JORDAN (V.O.)
He was a numbers guy, a follow-the-fucking-money’er. He wasn’t gonna come at me through my guys, looking for a weak link and a quick kill. He was gonna come at me like an accountant would, the way Ness got Capone, through my books. Which meant? It was ass-covering time.


138	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	138

As Naomi looks on, 5 months pregnant, Jordan packs a suitcase.


Switzerland? Switzerland?
NAOMI
What the fuck is in

JORDAN
Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you fucking think?


139	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY	*139 (SUMMER ‘95)

Jordan sits talking with Rugrat and Donnie.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	80.


JORDAN (V.O.) Rugrat set up a meeting with a Swiss Banker he knew from law school who could launder our money, but it wasn’t till noon the next day.

Jordan glances at his watch, washes down a few ludes.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I knew if I timed my lude intake right, I’d sleep through the entire overnight flight.


140	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	140

Jordan stands before the Bullpen talking to his Brokers.

JORDAN (V.O.)
At four p.m. I popped a few ludes, which started kicking in by the time I finished our sales meeting. This was the tingle phase.


141	INT. CANASTEL’S - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘95)	141

Over dinner, a visibly high Jordan ravenously digs into his food as Donnie and four Blue Chip Hookers look on.

JORDAN (V.O.) By dinner I popped a few more on top of some cocktails and an valium or two. The slur phase.


142	INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘95)	142

On the crowded dance floor, Jordan gets knocked around like a marionette, saliva strung from his mouth.

JORDAN (V.O.) By eight thirty I’d done a few
more and pretty much lost my motor skills. This was the drool phase.


143	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘95)	143

Jordan is barely conscious as a Hooker rides him.

JORDAN (V.O.) And by ten I didn’t know who or what I was doing -- the amnesia
phase. We boarded the plane just before midnight.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	81.


144	INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘95)	*144

Jordan boards, slurring, drooling, completely wasted.

JORDAN (to a Stewardess)
Sweetheart! Look at you!

And as he hugs her, then stumbles toward his seat...


145	INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	*145

Quiet; morning sunlight bleeds through the window. Jordan’s eyes flicker open. He yawns, looks around, tries to get up; he can’t move. He looks down, sees six seat belts restraining his arms and legs. Jordan looks over at Donnie, mouth agape, asleep next to him.


Donnie.


Nuuhh?
JORDAN Donnie, wake up.

DONNIE

JORDAN
Untie me, shitbag. You think this is funny?

DONNIE
I didn’t tie you, the captain did. He almost tasered you.

JORDAN Why?


146	FLASHBACK --	146

As PASSENGERS scream, Jordan wildly humps a STEWARDESS, the CAPTAIN struggling to restrain him.

JORDAN (V.O.) This was fucking great. I hadn’t laundered a dime yet and already I was under arrest.


147	INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	*147

A pensive Jordan sits, mind racing.

JORDAN (V.O.) Worse yet was the plastic baggie of ludes that Donnie’d stuffed up his ass.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	82.


Jordan trades looks with Donnie, who shifts uncomfortably.

JORDAN (V.O.) But before he could even get a hemorrhoid--

Jordan sits with two CUSTOMS OFFICERS.	*

JORDAN (V.O.)	* --the whole thing was quashed by	* our friend the Swiss banker. Which	* was lucky for me, since so far I’d	* been able to keep Agent Fuckface	* unaware of the trip.	*

Another CUSTOMS OFFICER enters, whispers something to the * others. They shake Jordan’s hand and he leaves.	*

A limo pulls up at an office building. Jordan emerges
with Rugrat and Donnie.	*


149	INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - LOBBY - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	149

JEAN-JACQUES SAUREL greets them. 30s, suave. The lobby is ultra-modernist.

SAUREL Jordan Belfort! At last!
Nicholas has told me so much.

RUGRAT Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel.

JORDAN
Nice to make your acquaintance. This is some lobby you got.

SAUREL
Ah, yes. We gave our designer an unlimited budget and he exceeded it. Come! You must tell me all about your adventure with the stewardess over coffee!

They disappear upstairs.

151	INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAUREL’S OFFICE - DAY	151

Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and
one other SWISS BANKER. It’s an impressive office, with	* an enormous fish tank.

DONNIE
We have a joke in America. “Heaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss.” I never got it ‘til now -- look at those fucking fish! Come here, little guy...

SAUREL
Yes, we have the same joke here. Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French. The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that.

Polite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish, cuts straight to the point:


JORDAN
I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws.

SAUREL
Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit-chat before business can be discussed.
(a smile)
Of course, let’s get “down to it.” What would you like to know?

JORDAN
Under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an FBI or U.S. Justice Department investigation?


Ca depend.


Ca depend?
SAUREL


JORDAN
Ca depend on what?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	84.


SAUREL
Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months.

RUGRAT
Want me to see if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix?

More chuckles. Through Jordan’s forced smile:

JORDAN (V.O.) What I’m asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over.

SAUREL (V.O.) I understand perfectly, you American shitheel.

Saurel smiles.

SAUREL
The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland. But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your “rumored” improprieties. Which is why Mr. Azoff’s joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you. If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette. We would wipe our ass with it.

Everyone’s impressed. Except Jordan.

JORDAN
Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland. Then you’d have to cooperate.

SAUREL
(now he’s impressed) Yes, we would. Assuming the account is under your name.
However, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours...

They take each other in.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	85.


JORDAN (V.O.)
Was that yodeling I just heard or did you just say what I thought you said?

SAUREL (V.O.) Yes! Yes!

As the meeting wraps up with handshakes, Jordan’s V.O. overwhelms Saurel’s V.O..

JORDAN (V.O.) He was telling me to use a
rathole. Problem was: sneaking a U.S. rathole into Switzerland was a chance I couldn’t take. What I needed was somebody with a European passport.

Naomi’s Aunt Emma answers the door.

AUNT EMMA Jordan?

JORDAN

155	EXT. HYDE PARK - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	155

Amid towering trees and horse trails, a noticeably twitchy Jordan walks arm-in-arm with Aunt Emma.

AUNT EMMA
So tell me about this plan of yours.

JORDAN
I’d like us to go to Switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account. I’ll fund it, and I’ll pay you really well for your trouble.

AUNT EMMA Oh my.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	86.


JORDAN
Next month maybe you can fly to New York and we can start moving the cash.

AUNT EMMA Moving the cash.
(smiles)
I feel like a character in an
Ian Fleming novel. It’s all quite racy, isn’t it?

JORDAN
It is, and it’s illegal too. Of course if you ever got in trouble, I’d come forward in two seconds, say I duped you, but even still.

AUNT EMMA
Risk is what keeps us young, isn’t it darling?

JORDAN
I like that attitude. Promise me	* you’ll spend at least ten thousand
pounds per month out of the account, okay?

AUNT EMMA (chuckles)
I wouldn't even know how. I really do have everything I need.

JORDAN But I bet you don't have
everything you want. How about a bigger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over?

Aunt Emma notices that Jordan is sweating, fidgety. He’s jonesing.

AUNT EMMA Shall we sit?

JORDAN Sure, that’d be great.

They sit on a nearby bench. After a while:

AUNT EMMA Sometimes I wonder if you let money get the best of you, dear.
(beat)
Among other substances.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	87.


JORDAN It’s that obvious, huh?

AUNT EMMA
It’s the height of summer and	* you’ve got the chills.	*

JORDAN
I’m a drug addict, Emma. Coke,	* pills, you name it, whatever you	* got. Sex addict too.	*

AUNT EMMA (laughs)
Well there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.

JORDAN (chuckles; then)
Why did I just tell you that?	*

AUNT EMMA (playful)
Because I’m very easy to talk to.

Jordan looks at her. A few beats, then:

JORDAN
As a matter of fact you are. My	* job, you know, it’s tough. I mean	* I’m not complaining, it’s just the
stress. All these people depending	* on me. Millions of dollars at	* stake every day. I sometimes feel	* I’ve bitten off more than I can	* chew.	*

AUNT EMMA
You’re a man with large appetites.

Jordan looks at her and smiles:

JORDAN (V.O.) Is she fucking hitting on me?

JORDAN
I agree. I put it on myself. It’s	* hard to control the anxiety, you	* know? It’s hard to learn to relax.	*

AUNT EMMA To release the tension.

JORDAN (V.O.)
She is hitting on me! Holy shit!

Jordan leans in closer, casually slips an arm around her.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	88.


JORDAN
Exactly, to release the tension.	* Sometimes you gotta learn to do	* what comes natural in life, huh?	*

Aunt Emma pulls back slightly.

AUNT EMMA (V.O.) Is he fucking hitting on me?

He leans in even closer, kisses her, then:	*

AUNT EMMA Stability, dear. Family.

AUNT EMMA (CONT’D)	* You take care of my niece, my
love. And I’ll take care of
everything over here.	* (a beat)	*
Ah, once upon a time...	*


155A	INT. BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - SOUTH HAMPTON - DAY	155A (SUMMER ‘95)

Jordan fucks Naomi. There’s a curious thunk-thunk-thunk.

JORDAN (V.O.)
When I got home, I realized there was no way Aunt Emma could smuggle that much cash by herself. I racked my brain for another person with a foreign passport.

The bed’s covered with bundles of cash. Every thrust of Jordan’s, another bundle plummets to the floor -- thunk.

158	INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY	158 (SUMMER ‘95)

With $20 mil in CASH on the bed, Jordan and a stoned Donnie watch as Brad tapes stacks of cash to his wife CHANTALLE, a bombshell in panties, bra and sneakers.

CHANTALLE
Bra-had, theese tape eez focking steeky!

As Brad keeps taping her up:
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	89.


JORDAN (V.O.)
As a successful drug dealer, Brad spent his winters in the South of France, which is where he met his wife Chantalle, a stripper of Slovenian origin but born in, of all places, Switzerland.

CHANTALLE
Take eet off, Bra-had! Eet erts!

BRAD Shut up, bitch.

CHANTALLE
You beetch, you focking douche-a-bag-a!

Donnie can’t help but start laughing at this.

DONNIE
Take eet off! Take eet off!

Brad seethes at this but keeps taping...


159	INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - BEDROOM - LATER	159 (SUMMER ‘95)

Chantalle is completely taped up, a cash-covered mummy. Jordan looks on with Brad, Donnie and now Naomi. 90% of the cash is still on the bed.

JORDAN Well, this is fucked.

NAOMI
It’s gonna take her like fifty trips.

BRAD
We’ll get her parents to tape up too. They got Swiss passports. Plus her brother and his wife. Five people, six-seven trips?

JORDAN
How much’ll they want for it?

BRAD
I dunno, not much. Fuck, they’d probably do it just for the miles.

DONNIE What about my money?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	90.


BRAD What?

DONNIE
My money. I got a few mil of my own I wanna move. I’ll call you, you can come pick it up.

BRAD (takes offense to
Donnie’s presumption)
You’ll “call” me.

DONNIE (what part don’t you
understand?)
And you can come “pick it up.”

Brad asks Jordan if they can speak in private.

MOMENTS LATER, IN PRIVATE: Jordan joins Brad.

JORDAN What’s wrong?

BRAD
Don’t make me deal with this fucknut, okay?

JORDAN
Donnie? He’s just high is all.

BRAD
I dunno if he’s stupid or a junkie but he’s a loose fuckin’ cannon. I don’t trust him and I don’t want him around me.

JORDAN
Jesus. I thought he was your best customer.

BRAD
I only sell to him cuz he’s your friend.

JORDAN
Can you just do one trip for him?

Brad stews. It’s asking a lot.

BRAD
I’ll meet him but I won’t pick up. I have a limit of how much of that douchebag I can take.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	91.


DONNIE
I can hear you, motherfucker!

Donnie emerges from where he’s been eavesdropping.

DONNIE (CONT’D) I’m a douchebag?!! Well, whose fucking idea was it made us all this money?!! Who fucking knew Steve Madden?!! This douchebag!! So go fuck yourself a little!

Brad slaps Donnie so hard across the face he goes down.

JORDAN (V.O.) The next day, Aunt Emma flew to
Geneva, two million in cash in her carry-on.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Brad waits by his Range Rover as Donnie’s Rolls careens into the lot. He emerges, briefcase in hand.

DONNIE Fu Manchu! Kung fu!

Donnie starts doing spastic karate moves. Is he high? Sure looks like it. Brad looks pissed, and Donnie starts laughing. Actually he’s dead sober.

DONNIE (CONT’D) I’m just fucking with you, man. Jesus, the look on your face.
(Brad isn’t laughing)
Hey, sorry if I got outta line the other day, I was just, that was the drugs talking...

BRAD
S’cool, just... gimme the case.

DONNIE (he doesn’t)
You know, I always kinda regretted you didn’t come to work with us at Stratton. It’d be so cool having you around, man.

BRAD (growing impatient)
Yeah, well...

DONNIE
You’d be one of us, we’d go out-partying together, you wouldn’t have to dress like a mall rat guinea prison bitch all the time.

Donnie grins, obviously still smarting from Brad’s slap. Brad just wants to take the money and be done.

BRAD Give me the money.

A DISTANCE AWAY, a COP in a patrol car notices Brad gesturing to Donnie for his briefcase. He nudges his partner: check this out.

DONNIE
Can I come over and help tape this to your wife? “Eez so focking steeky! Take eet off, Bra-hod!”

Brad composes himself, lest he kill the guy.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	93.


BRAD
I’m gonna give you a pass.

DONNIE You’re what?

BRAD
I’m gonna give you a pass.

DONNIE

BRAD
Yes. Just gimme the money.

DONNIE
You’re gonna give me a pass? Okay...
(offers the case)
Why don’t you stick your pass up your Slavic cunt’s pussy.

That does it. Brad attacks. Donnie throws the case at him, which opens on impact, money spilling out. Brad instinctively tries to contain it... and that’s when the POLICE SIRENS start. Here comes the patrol car.

BRAD Shit!

Donnie bolts. With no time to get to his car, Brad takes off on foot, bleeding briefcase in hand, toward a video store where he stashes his .38 in the return box.

POLICE Freeze! Don’t move!

Brad drops to his knees, briefcase at his feet. From a distance, Donnie peers around a corner to watch him get arrested, knowing he fucked this up.

JORDAN You fucking serious?!

CLOSE ON -- a Lemmon 714 Quaalude; pure white, with trademark ridged edges.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) The Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail
of Quaaludes, outlawed since the ‘80s and three times as powerful as anything available today. For a Quaalude addict, it was like finding a 1952 Chateau Margaux.

CLOSE ON -- Donnie gauging Jordan’s excitement, waiting for the right moment to admit his fuck-up.

DONNIE(V.O.) I’d been saving these for a
special occasion, like a birthday or celebrating our money being out of the country. Instead I thought I’d better use ‘em to help break the news about Brad.

Jordan can’t respond. Phone still to his ear, his eyelids droop. Drool spills from his slackened jaw.

JORDAN (V.O.) After fifteen years in storage, the Lemmons had developed a delayed fuse.

JORDAN’S POV -- is hazy as he stares at his own reflection in the pay phone.

JORDAN (V.O.)
It took 90 minutes for the little fuckers to kick in, but once they did -- pow! I had skipped the tingle phase and went straight to the drool phase.

JORDAN’S POV -- the phone gets further and further away.

JORDAN (V.O.) Actually I’d discovered a new phase: the cerebral palsy phase.

Jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach for it; he can’t. He lays there for a while, then:

He rolls onto all fours, lifts a hand, topples over.

Forcing himself over the edge, Jordan begins to descend the steps, one at a time. Thump. Thump. Then faster. Thump- Thump-Thump. Faster still. He loses control, takes all the steps at once. Thump-Thump-Thump-Thump-Thump-Thump. He lands with a crash on the asphalt, drags himself up and into the Lamborghini.

table with a tremendous CRASH! Naomi rushes back in.	*

NAOMI
Omigod, he’s choking! Jordan, do something!!

Just then, WE HEAR the triumphant Popeye FANFARE --Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of spinach down his gullet. Instantly, his chest and arm muscles swell to five times their size.

Jordan goes to get his coke. He snarfs up two fat spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue...

Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue.

NAOMI (CONT’D) He’s not breathing!

Jordan places his fingers over Donnie’s artery. Nothing.

NAOMI (CONT’D) Save him!

Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnie’s chest, breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts.

JORDAN (V.O.) This stupid sonovabitch! All
Donnie ever did was fuck me up and now I had to save his life ‘cause I took a CPR class when the baby was learning to swim. Just for the record, I want it noted: not for a second did I even think about letting him choke to death, even though it would’ve saved me an awful lot of headaches.

Donnie still isn’t breathing. Jordan flips him over, tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks Donnie’s ribs. He flips him back over, but he’s almost completely blue.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	103.


JORDAN He won’t come back!

Don’t let him die! He has children!

One last try. Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as hard as he can into Donnie’s lungs. Donnie’s stomach distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham projects from his mouth and into Jordan’s face. Donnie coughs, vomiting. And as he starts breathing again,
Jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch.	*

Jordan exits the house with the Police Officers. The Lamborghini is TOTALLED, an absolute wreck.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Wow. Maybe I hadn’t made it home okay.


201	EXT. HEGEMAN’S ROAD - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER ‘95)	201

FLASHBACK. Nodding out, Jordan drives the Lamborghini like a maniac, careening off parked cars and trees.

JORDAN (V.O.) It was an absolute miracle I
wasn’t killed, and an even bigger miracle I hadn’t killed anyone.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	104.


201A	INT. POLICE STATION - DAY (LATE SUMMER ‘95)	2*01A

A MAN steps up to get his mug shot taken, but it’s Brad, not Jordan. FLASH. Turn to the side. FLASH.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But they couldn’t arrest me, the cops had no proof I’d been behind
the wheel. Meanwhile, Brad did a	* few months in jail for contempt	* because he wouldn’t rat Donnie
out. They never found his gun, though, so they finally had to let him go.

202B	EXT. HORSE FARM - LONG ISLAND - DAY (OCT ‘95)	202B

Jordan watches an INSTRUCTOR lead Skylar on a pony. Nearby Naomi holds newborn PARKER. Manny Riskin and Max stand beside Jordan.

MANNY RISKIN You’re a lucky guy, Jordan. Legally I’ve never seen anyone slip a noose the way you do. Christ, you’re lucky to be alive much less not in jail.

JORDAN
I don’t believe in luck.

MANNY RISKIN That’s what all lucky people say. It’s time, Jordan. Let me make a deal with SEC. Before your luck runs out.

Skylar waves from the pony and Jordan waves back.

JORDAN What kind of terms?

MANNY RISKIN
You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations -- stock manipulation, high pressure sales tactics, ticky-tack shit like that. You pay a few million dollars in fines and in exchange the SEC fucks off for all time.

JORDAN
And Stratton? What happens there?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	105.


MANNY RISKIN You’d have to walk away. Let Donnie take over.
(that one hurts)
Now the FBI’s a different animal. They can still pursue you for criminal wrongdoing. But with you on the sidelines, my guess is your best friend Agent Denham’ll be left standing around with his dick in his hand.

Jordan digests that.

MAX
You beat them, Jordan. You won. Sail into the sunset with your wife and kids while you can.

MANNY RISKIN God knows you’ll never have to work again.

As Jordan looks at his picture-perfect family, WE HEAR THE ROAR OF A CROWD...

202C	SCENES 202C - 202D OMITTED	202C


202E	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY	202E (SPRING ‘96)

The troops ROAR as Jordan takes center stage.

JORDAN
I’m sure many of you have been hearing rumors lately, about me, about the future of this firm, and that’s what I’d like to talk to you about today.
(a few beats, then) Five years ago when I started
Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day would eventually come when I’d be moving on. It’s truly with a heavy heart that I tell you that day is here.

The place erupts in a chorus of “No!”, “Don’t go!”, etc. Jordan raises his hand for quiet.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Thank you for that and for your years of incredible loyalty and admiration.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	106.

JORDAN (CONT’D) The point is though, that under Donnie’s leadership, along with Robbie Feinberg and Nicky Koskoff moving into key management positions, this place is gonna be better than ever!

A smattering of applause. Jordan notices a few Brokers gravely shaking their heads.

JORDAN (CONT’D) And the fact that I'm gone won’t
stop me from giving Donnie advice, not that he needs any--

DONNIE (jumping in)
Why would anyone in their right mind not follow JB's advice?

Donnie looks petrified; he’s used to being an offensive tackle, not the quarterback.

JORDAN
Before I go, there’s something I want to remind you all, and that’s this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger than any one person, even me. Especially me. You guys are Stratton, each and every one of you, and that is why it’s sure to remain the best brokerage firm in the fucking world!

Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all 300 Brokers on their feet. WE PUSH IN on Jordan.

JORDAN (CONT’D) See, the very idea of Stratton is that when you come here and step into this bullpen for the first time, you start your life anew. You have a place here and no one can take that away from you! Stratton Oakmont is America! Give me your tired and poor! The very moment you walk through that door and pledge your loyalty to this firm, you become part of a family, you become a Strattonite! It doesn’t matter who you are, it doesn’t matter where you’re from! Whether your family came over on the Mayflower or on a fucking inner tube from Haiti!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	107.


More applause. Jordan scans the young faces -- they worship him. In the crowd he finds KIMMIE BELZER, 30s.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Everybody here knows Kimmie Belzer, right?

Hoots and hollers... He raises his hand for quiet.

JORDAN (CONT’D) In case any of you weren't aware of it, Kimmie was one of Stratton's first brokers, one of the original twenty. Now when most of you met Kimmie, you met her the way she is today -- a
beautiful woman who drives a brand new Mercedes, a woman who lives in the finest condo complex on Long Island. A woman who wears $3000 Armani suits, who spends her winters in the Bahamas and her summers in the Hamptons!

Wild applause.

JORDAN (CONT’D) But that’s not the Kimmie I met. The Kimmie I met was broke, a single mom on the balls of her ass. Three months behind on her rent with an eight year old son! She came to me for a job and when I hired her she asked for a $5000 dollar advance so she could pay his tuition. And what did I do, Kimmie?

KIMMIE
You wrote me a check for $25,000!

JORDAN
Because I believed in you, like I believe in each and every one of you!

KIMMIE I love you, Jordan!

As the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the adoration. He looks at Donnie, turns back to the Crowd, looks out at the faces. A change has come over him.
He stands there, thinking. An eternity, then:
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	108.


JORDAN
You know for years I’ve been telling you guys not to take no for an answer, to keep pushing, to not hang up the phone till you get what you want. This deal I’m about to sign, barring me from the securities industry, barring me from Stratton, my home... What the fuck is that? I’ll tell you what it is, it’s me being a hypocrite. It’s me taking no for an answer, it’s them selling me, not the other way around! Fuck it, I’m not leaving!

Jordan smiles, thrusts his hands in the air --

JORDAN (CONT’D) THE SHOW GOES ON!!

The place goes absolutely INSANE. And as Donnie and Max trade looks, TECHNO MUSIC BLASTS taking us to...


202Ea	EXT. YACHT NAOMI - AFT DECK - DAY (SPRING ‘96)	202Ea

It’s celebration time. DOZENS of Strattonites party, drinking/dancing/snorting, Jordan at the center of it.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Of course, the troops weren’t the	* only ones who were thrilled.	*


202F	INT. DENHAM’S OFFICE - DAY (SPRING ‘96)	202F

Agent Denham hears the news over the phone. A smile touches his lips: his case goes on...


202Fa	EXT. YACHT NAOMI - AFT DECK (SPRING ‘96)	20*2Fa

The party continues as Brad comes aboard. He’s welcomed	* and showered with lapdancers.	*

JORDAN (V.O.)	* I apologized to Brad and promised	* him he’d never have to deal with	* Donnie again. Even offered to pay	* him for his time in the can. But	* he said no, he was out. Sad thing	* was, he was dead two years later.	* Massive heart attack while sitting	* on the john.	*

202H	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	202H (SPRING ‘96)

Janet enters Jordan’s office, leaves a stack of legal papers on his desk.

JORDAN (V.O.) Within days, subpoenas started flying. They were burying me in paper --


202Ha	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (SPRING ‘96)	202Ha

Donnie pisses on a subpoena, to applause.

JORDAN (V.O.)
-- notices to produce documents, depositions. Donnie couldn’t drink water fast enough.


202J	INT. S.E.C. - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY (SPRING ‘96)	2*02J

As Manny Riskin looks on, Jordan sits across from the three SEC Attorneys and a COURT REPORTER.

JORDAN (V.O.) They interrogated everybody, it
went on for months. It was total fucking harassment...


202K-Q	A SERIES OF CUTS -- (SPRING ‘96)	202*K-Q

Various Stratton Brokers are deposed: Robbie; Rugrat, Peter DeBlasio, Sea Otter; Chester Ming.

JORDAN (V.O.)
... but not a single Strattonite cracked. Donnie and I were given strict instructions not to leave the country...

JORDAN (V.O.)	* ...so we took our wives to Italy.	* Each of us had a couple of million	* we needed to deposit anyway --	*

ON A DUFFEL BAG FULL OF MONEY just resting on deck.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	110.


JORDAN (V.O.)
-- this seemed the most civilized way to transport it overseas.

ON ANOTHER BAG, this one brimming with bottles of pills, bags of pot, vials of coke. Jordan and Donnie cut up lines as a HOSTESS serves Bloody Marys.

HOSTESS
Can I get you anything else, gentlemen?

JORDAN
I have a rare condition that requires me to drink one of these every fifteen minutes. If you could set your egg timer, I’d appreciate it.

She goes. The blow is ready for inhaling. Jordan and Donnie are doing a “you first, no, you first” routine with a rolled up $100 when a CELL rings. Donnie grabs it.

DONNIE
Rugrat! Bongiorno, my bald eagle!	*

208D	EXT. YACHT NAOMI - DAY (SUMMER ‘96)	2*08D

Donnie reacts as Rugrat expounds.

DONNIE
What?! You’re fucking kidding?!	*

RUGRAT	* No. I wish I was.	*

DONNIE	* (to Jordan)	*
Rugrat says Steve Madden’s	* unloading shares.	*

JORDAN	* What?! (Grabs Donnie’s phone)	* Rugrat, what the fuck?	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	111.

JORDAN (CONT'D)
(Hands Donnie his phone) Call the	* sonovabitch! Hold on a second.	*

BACK AT STRATTON...	*

RUGRAT	* I’m looking at the screen and huge	* chunks of Steve Madden are being	* sold. We’re not doing it so it’s	* gotta be Steve. He’s the only	* person who owns that many shares.	*

ON THE BOAT...	*

Jordan cups the phone, looks to Donnie who shrugs.

DONNIE He’s not picking up.

JORDAN
Your fucking friend is trying to fuck me. And you know where he’s trying to fuck me? Up the ass.
(back to Rugrat)
I need some time to think.	*

Jordan thinks, snorts a line to think better.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Even though I owned 85% of Steve-Cocksucker-Madden-fucking-Shoes, the shares were in his fucking name. Motherfucker knew I was in trouble with the Feds and was trying to take advantage.

He gets back on the phone with Rugrat.

JORDAN
Tell all the brokers to sell.	* Drive the price down. Steve will	* go cockless when he watches me	* turn his company into a penny	* stock.	*
(he hangs up) Sonovacunt!
(yelling below deck) Captain Ted!! Start ‘er up, we
gotta go home!	*

The sight of Naomi and Hildy returning from their trip ashore stops him. Because Naomi’s weeping, Hildy consoling her.

JORDAN (CONT’D) What the fuck?! What happened?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	112.


NAOMI
I got a call from cousin Betty. Aunt Emma’s dead.

Off Jordan’s reaction as Naomi weeps and laments the dearly departed: “she was so young, so healthy” etc. --

JORDAN (V.O.) Fucking heart attack. Boom-snap, she was gone. Shuffled off her mortal coil and twenty million dollars in a Swiss bank account.


208E	INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAUREL’S OFFICE - DAY	208E (SUMMER ‘96)

Jean-Jacques Saurel sits at his desk, calmly smoking as he talks on the phone.

SAUREL
It is terrible. Your aunt was such an elegant, attractive woman. My condolences to you and your family. You must be --

208F	INTERCUT JORDAN ON THE BOAT AND SAUREL IN GENEVA	208F

JORDAN (no time for it)
Thanks but where does this leave us in regard to her account? It goes into probate or what?

SAUREL
Not to worry, Jordan. Your aunt, before she died, signed a document naming you as her successor.

JORDAN She did?!

SAUREL (a sly grin)
Well. Not as of yet.

And as they continue talking, Jordan pulls out a nautical map of the Italian coastline:

JORDAN (V.O.) I gotta say, these Swiss were sneaky motherfuckers. Within
minutes he made arrangements to set me up with a forger, the best document specialist in Geneva.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	113.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Thing was: I had to get there in three business days to co-sign on the account.

Jordan goes rapid-fire. He yells:	*

JORDAN
Captain Ted! Change of plan!	* We’re going to Monaco.	*

NAOMI
Monaco, now?	*

JORDAN	* Yes, babe. We’re going to Monaco	* so then we can go to Switzerland.	*

HILDY
But her aunt just died, we can’t go to --

JORDAN
I realize that but we have to go	* to Switzerland.	*

DONNIE
What about --	*

JORDAN (way ahead of him)
-- keep calling, when the fuck picks up, set a meet with him in
three business days.	*

NAOMI
We gotta go to London.	*

JORDAN Why?!

NAOMI The funeral.

JORDAN	* Honey, I loved your Aunt Emma more	* than anyone in the world, but	* she’s still gonna be dead in two	* days. She’s not going anywhere.	*

Captain Ted Beecham emerges from below.

JORDAN (CONT’D)
Captain Ted, we’ve gotta get to	* Monaco.

CAPTAIN TED	* Monaco?	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	114.


JORDAN	* Then we drive to Switzerland so	* they don’t stamp our passports.	* Take care of business. Drive back	* to Monaco, fly to London for the	* funeral, fly back to New York to	* be there in three business days -	* That’s the fuckin’ plan.	*

CAPTAIN TED I’m getting reports of some
weather out there. Might run into some chop.

HILDY	* We’re not going anywhere until he	* says it’s safe.	*

DONNIE	* Chop is fine.	*

JORDAN	* Is it safe?	*

CAPTAIN TED	* If we take it slow...	*

JORDAN	* We can do it?	*

CAPTAIN TED	* Chop is chop. Some chop - it can	* be uncomfortable.	*

JORDAN	* Well, that’s fine.	*

CAPTAIN TED	* Anything is possible. I mean we’ll	* have to batten down the hatches	* just to be safe. Could be a few	* broken dishes.	*

209	EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘96)	209

The perfect storm. As the Naomi tips at a 45-degree angle, a thick wall of gray water comes rising over her side, slamming onto the bridge with a thunderous CRASH.

JORDAN (V.O.) Well talk about your shitty vacations...

Six Jet Skis plummet off the deck into the raging sea.


210	INT. YACHT NAOMI - BRIDGE - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘96)	210

Donnie and Naomi stand on the bridge where Captain Ted	* Beecham holds the ship's wheel with both hands, the radio blaring in the background. Jordan enters.	*

JORDAN	* What the fuck is going on?	*

CAPTAIN TED	* Jet skis just went overboard.	*

RADIO VOICE
Gale warning! Gale warning!	*

CAPTAIN TED The waves are twenty feet and building!

JORDAN Can’t you turn us around?!

CAPTAIN TED We’ll get broad-sided and tip over!

RADIO VOICE Gale warning! Gale warning!

Naomi turns to Jordan, furious with him.

NAOMI
You happy now, you piece of shit?	* We’re gonna drown.	*

JORDAN
I’m a master diver. We will not                   * drown, I promise you. I got you,                  * baby.                                             * (realizing she’s                             *

DONNIE What?

JORDAN
Get the fucking ludes!	*

DONNIE
They’re below deck! There’s like three feet of water down there!

JORDAN
What’s happening?!	*

CAPTAIN TED	* Rogue wave!	*

Jordan grabs Naomi. All at once the boat dips down at an * impossibly steep angle, until it’s pointing almost	* straight down. Captain Ted jams the throttle and the	* boat jerks forward, rising up the face of a giant rogue	* wave, which curls over the top of the bridge and...	*

KABOOM! -- Blackness. Slowly, painfully, the boat pops	* up from beneath the water, its helicopter RIPPING from	* the deck and crashing into the sea.	*

CAPTAIN TED (CONT’D) (into radio)
Mayday! This is Captain Ted Beecham aboard the Yacht Naomi! This is a Mayday!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	117.

CAPTAIN TED (CONT’D) We are going down at the head fifty miles off the coast of Rome and we require immediate assistance!


211	INT. ITALIAN NAVAL DESTROYER - BELOW DECK - NIGHT	*211 (SUMMER ‘96)

Off to the side, Jordan watches as Naomi, their Friends, and the yacht’s Crew Members dance to blaring techno music. A small group of Italian SAILORS cheer them on.

JORDAN (V.O.) The nice thing about getting rescued by Italians is that the first thing they do is feed you and make you drink red wine. Then they make you dance.

Jordan watches as the dancing continues, then casually glances out a porthole, where WE SEE the distant lights of a PLANE making its way across the night sky. After a few beats, the plane EXPLODES, a tiny flash of light.

JORDAN (V.O.) Did you see that? That was the
plane I sent for to come get us. I shit you not, it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine, three people killed. You want a sign from God, well after all this I finally got the message. I had to make some fucking changes.

FADE OUT.

The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	118.


NAOMI	* Well, it’s there. So the kids are	* gonna start.	*

Naomi exits. Jordan goes back to work. Looks up at TV.	* Watches for a bit.	*

CUT TO:

Shot on 90’s-era video, an ad intended for late-night local tv. The defining idea here is that while the commercial may be amateurish, Jordan isn’t; he’s an excellent salesman even if the ad is cut-rate.

WE START WITH FLASHES OF THE SEMINAR: Jordan in front of a dry erase board, lecturing a small audience.

JORDAN
At the essence of every personal interaction, of every business transaction, of every effective human communication is PERSUASION... once you learn to control the linguistic encounter, you will be SHOCKED at what will happen... you are a person worth listening to, and taking it one step higher than that, you are someone who can help them achieve their goals...

215B	JORDAN ON THE GROUNDS OF HIS ESTATE, addressing us.	215B

JORDAN (CONT’D)
Do you dream of being financially independent but struggle every month just to pay your bills?
Would you like to own a home like	* this one someday but can barely
afford to pay your rent? (ZOOM IN ON HIM)
My name is Jordan Belfort and there’s no secret to wealth creation. No matter who you are,
where you came from, you too can	* become financially independent in
just a matter of months. All you need is a strategy.
(NEW ANGLE; he enters from same side as previous shot)
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	119.

JORDAN (CONT’D) The first action you have to take is to DECIDE to be wealthy. When I was 24 years old, I made a DECISION not to just survive but
to THRIVE. I started my own stock
brokerage firm, developing a	* SYSTEM OF SELLING that within a
year made me a multi-millionaire.

CLOSE ON JORDAN’S HANDS, at last in cuffs. PAN UP TO HIM, looking none-too-pleased.

JORDAN (V.O.) This one takes the cake. It was Rugrat, he’d been busted down in Miami, and guess who the fuck with?


219	EXT. MIAMI RESTAURANT - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	219

Jean-Jacques Saurel is handcuffed by Feds as Rugrat looks on crying, handcuffed nearby.

JORDAN (V.O.)
What were the odds? There had to be ten thousand Swiss bankers in Geneva and I choose the one dumb enough to get himself arrested on U.S. soil.

221	EXT. MIAMI MANSION - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	221

ROCKY AOKI, Japanese, 50s, is led out in handcuffs by a MAN in an FBI windbreaker.

JORDAN (V.O.) Something about laundering drug money through offshore boat racing and a guy named Rocky Aoki, the founder of Benihana.

221A	INSERT BENI HANA COMMERCIAL --	221A

A smiling Rocky Aoki looks on as a HIBACHI CHEF expertly dices shrimp on a sizzling grill.

Chantalle emerges from the bathroom naked. Laughing, she runs and jumps in bed with Saurel.

Jordan walks with Nolan Drager, who flips through the	* subpoena.	*

NOLAN DRAGER	* This is...well, it’s not good.	* It’s pretty bad actually. How	* much money do you have, Jordan?	*

JORDAN	* I can make bail.	*

NOLAN DRAGER	* I don’t mean the ten million, I	* mean for legal fees. Cuz if you	* want to fight this thing, it’s	* gonna be expensive. Like, sell-	* everything-you-own-expensive.	*

Jordan exits the building. He’s fucked and he knows it. He sees beautiful Naomi waiting for him beside a limosine; life isn’t totally hopeless. He approaches.

JORDAN
Nay, thank God. I’m so glad you’re here.

They embrace. He can’t see her expression: she’d rather be anywhere else.

226	EXT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - POOL AREA - DAY (SEP ‘98)	226

ON SKYLAR AND PARKER, playing with a NANNY and Rocky the dog. Jordan watches them, sitting by his pool, drinking an O’Douls, weighing his options.

Donnie pops into the yard, in “Uncle Donnie” mode.

DONNIE
Hey, everybody! How’re the happiest people in Long Island? Hi, Rocky!!
(joining Jordan) Hate that fucking dog.

JORDAN
Tell me about it. It’s getting old, starting to shit inside the house again.

Jordan offers Donnie an O’Douls; Donnie declines.

DONNIE How you doing, brother? the food in jail?

JORDAN Lobster Newburg sucked. me some jewelry though.

How was



They gave

He shows off the electronic bracelet around his ankle.

DONNIE
Wonder if they got one in my size. Fuckin’ Rugrat, that wig-wearin’ hump. Tell you one thing: I’m never eating at Benihana’s again. Where’s Naomi?

JORDAN Inside. Pissed.

Donnie sees Naomi in a window. He waves but she barely registers him.

DONNIE What’s up her ass?

JORDAN
Had to mortgage the home to make bail. Probably gonna hafta sell it to pay my lawyers. If we fight this thing.

Donnie weighs that.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	124.


DONNIE
The Feds say anything about coming after the rest of us?

Jordan thinks, then shakes his head no.

DONNIE (CONT’D) You know, we’re all behind you. Everyone at the office.
(he removes an envelope, hands it to Jordan)
We bought back your mortgage. All the founding partners threw in a million apiece. Figured none of us would have it if it weren’t for you.

Jordan’s profoundly touched. Donnie squeezes his shoulder. A real moment of friendship.

DONNIE (CONT’D) You gotta fight this thing, baby.

Jordan nods.

JORDAN (V.O.) Like I said, loyalty meant a lot to me. Without your friends and
family standing behind you, you’re fucked.

Jordan sits with Nolan Drager across from FBI Agent	* Denham, U.S. Attorney LUCAS SOLOMON, 50s, and Assistant	* U.S. Attorney ROCHELLE APPLEBAUM, 30s, humorless.	*

LUCAS SOLOMON	* There’s a term we have around	* here, we don’t like to use it	* often, only when circumstances	* dictate. It’s called a “Grenada.”	* Inspired by our government’s	* invasion in 1983 of the island	* nation of only 90,000 people,	* basically it stands for any case	* we get which is pretty much unlose-	* able. We could show up late and	* drunk to court, fuck up left-right-	* and-center and still we’d win.	* Mr. Belfort, you, sir, are a	* “Grenada.”	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	125.


ROCHELLE APPLEBAUM	* You’re looking at real prison	* time. Money laundering gets you	* as much as 20 years. Case	* couldn’t be stronger if we’d have	* caught you with your cash in your	* mattress.	*

Solomon pushes a box full of evidence across the table.	* Jordan eyeballs Denham.	*

LUCAS SOLOMON	* Read the discovery.	*

JORDAN	* That your life’s work in the box?	*

AGENT DENHAM	* Jordan, you rotting in jail til	* your kids’re outta college isn’t	* our ambition here. You weren’t	* the only one involved in all this.	* We think those folks deserve their	* day in court too.	*

NOLAN DRAGER	* Why do I get the sense there’s an
offer in the air? If so, let’s	* put it on the table.	*

LUCAS SOLOMON
Full cooperation. A comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire.

JORDAN You want me to rat?

LUCAS SOLOMON	* We want your cooperation in --	*

AGENT DENHAM	* Yes. We want you to rat.	*

JORDAN	* Baby, I talked to the lawyers	* again today. I have some really	* great news. As it turns out you’re	* totally off the hook.	*

NAOMI	* I know that already.	*

JORDAN	* You never did anything wrong	* anyway, right? At the end of the	* day all they really want is for me	* to cooperate - that’s it.	* See, apparently, I know so much	* about what’s going on in the stock	* market that I could save the	* government years of heartache.

You see,	* if I cooperate I’ll only have to	* serve four short years and any	* fine I’d have to pay wouldn’t be	* due til after I serve my sentence.	* We’ll still have plenty of money	* left over.

JORDAN	* But there’s a silver lining to	* that too... It turns out that all	* of ‘em are probably gonna	* cooperate too. So in the end, that	* won’t really be a factor.	*

JORDAN (V.O.)
For the next six hours, I came up with a list. Friends, enemies, business associates, anybody who’d ever known me or taken so much as a stock tip. The first name on the list was Donnie’s.

And as Jordan heaves a huge sigh, we’re suddenly...

The trial won’t be for months, so obviously I’ll be counting on you to pick up the slack.

DONNIE
Whatever you need, bro. You know that.

Jordan reaches in his jacket for a yellow slip of PAPER.

JORDAN
And you know how much that means to me. Hey, you know what I wanted to ask you?

Jordan catches Donnie’s eye, pushes the PAPER over in front of him.

JORDAN (CONT’D) The Steve Madden deal, did he ever come through on that?

Donnie looks down at the paper, reads Jordan’s writing:

“DON’T INCRIMINATE YOURSELF. I’M WEARING A WIRE.”

JORDAN (CONT’D) Remember he was supposed to kick back like four mil from that one account?

DONNIE
Uh... tell you the truth I was so fucked up, I don’t really remember anything about that.

Donnie slips the paper in his jacket, gives Jordan a look -- “Thank you.” Jordan nods.

JORDAN
Well if you talk to him, let me know. You want the last yellowtail?

DONNIE Why not?

JORDAN (V.O.) And thus began my career as a government cooperator. I was a rat...

Then: a MAN WITH A MIC steps out...	*

MAN WITH A MIC	* Ladies and gentlemen, please join	* me in welcoming to Auckland, New	* Zealand... Mr. Jordan Belfort!	*

BIG APPLAUSE as Jordan takes the stage, waving. This	* might go on a while. If so, there COULD be TITLES:	*

Jordan Belfort spent 22 months in federal prison	* and paid $100,000,000 in fines.	*

THEN:	*

His cellmate was, no fucking joke, Tommy Chong.	*

THEN:	*

Tell your Uncle Sam about the thing

[Intro : Slimka]
Mmh, yeah, Sierra-Lima-India-Mike-Kilo-Alpha
Tunnel vision, neuf juice, han, yo, wow, wow
Tu connais, l'équipe ne bouge pas
Han, yeah, wow, han

[Couplet 1 : Slimka]
C'est moi l'enfant du peuple, j'suis dans la tête des jeunes
J'suis dans la tête des vieux aussi, sans forcer, c'est naturel
C'est moi qui crée l'mouvement, c'est moi qui crée la vague
Depuis tout petit j'ai appris à partager mon assiette
J'respecte pas trop les bâtards qui osent oublier leurs reu-fré
Pour du [plomo, plata ?], en quelques s'condes peuvent t'la mettre
Ce n'est pas leurs vies mais ils veulent jouer les bandits
J'préfère rester à ma place, petit bédo et cannette
Jeune métisse donne d'la force à toute la ville, tu l'sais
Des quartiers nord aux sud, même de l'est à l'ouest
J'ai bien grandi, j'ai passé l'âge d'insulter les femmes
J'ai du respect pour toutes les daronnes qui s'battent corps et âme pour l'avenir de leurs enfants
Maman, I love you, on s'connait bientôt d'puis trente ans
Cassim a grandi, Cassim déborde de temps en temps
Mais j'reste focus, j'reste dans ma tunnel vision
Concentré, je prends toujours les bonnes décisions, han
[Pont : Salaam]
Hey, hey, wolu-wolu, han, han, han, hey, hey, ouais, hey
[? à 1:03] ze-trei, hey

[Couplet 2 : Salaam]
J'bois du rhum âgé avec une rom âgée
Pas l'temps d'jouer le [chromagé ?]
Du cheese à faire comme un fromager
C'est la West Coast dans les potagers
La taupe peut t'prendre en otage
Et bellek à c'que ton pote ingère
J'l'ai vu pop un ["G" ? à 1:14] j'ai les neurones H.S, le fond endommagé
J'vomis un seize, y a aucun mot mâché
Même si j'découpe des têtes comme monarchie
Et vise dans l'mille comme bon archer
J'suis un enfant d'ma ville
Mais elle aime pas voir ses mômes marcher (Han)
J'reste dans ma shit, j'cherche les dollars, les shekels (Cash)
Pas écolo mais j'prône la sauvegarde des espèces
J'croise des clochards, des préfets, des Honda, des Bentley
On connaît l'chômage, les vraies payes
Après l'cauchemar c'est l'réveil, yo
Des costards, des TN, des grosses liasses, des piécettes
Des bons gars et des traîtres, des mogwais et des gremlins
Le spotlight, les ténèbres, la bonne année des 'teilles
Ça m'rappelle l'époque où on traînait entre molards et Bel-Air (Han)
Tout l'quartier sous les yeux, les [verges ? à 1:42], les tiens, les deux
Zéro, five, vingt-deux, y a qu'dans nos poches qu'on aime les bleus
Son tarpé est moelleux, on jouait mais c'est plus un jeu
Dans la pièce c'est nuageux, le morceau est vénéneux, hey

J'suis sur l'terrain pour brasser, pas pour les goals
J'fais pas d'randonnée, dans la forêt, dans la faune
Des fantômes dans ma tête, dans ses bzez du silicone
J'suis en dessus comme un drone
J'suis une tempête, un cyclone
J'suis du filtré, t'es du jaune
J'suis en dessus comme un drone
Et tu " comme Gollum, m'trouver dans l'marécage, la zone
Ils sont drôles, ils pleurnichent comme des joueurs de football
Moi, il m'faut un baveux comme Saul
Toi joues pas avec le feu, c'est la punition qu'tu frôles
Quand j'étais p'tit, j'aimais pas les épinards
Pour ça qu'j'ai pas assez d'force pour en donner à ces pleurnichards
Tous des ringards, ils s'prennent en photo devant l'miroir
Des fantômes dans ma tête, du silicone dans ses nibards
Elle est passée sur l'billard, j'suis passé par l'boulevard
Du quartier j'suis passé, j'ai un gros salaire sur l'poignet
Que Dieu m'pardonne, elle est chargée la vago
J'dois boire de l'eau bénite, pas un latte macchiato
Pourquoi tu fais l'boss ? T'as pas l'passé à Pablo

Talk shit, put that shit straight to the [?], it'll give man chills
The way I attack like Messi, like Barce, like the Navy SEALS
I'm above them all like I'm their father, some are like "Uncle Phil"
Got mob ties with the Polish mafia like I'm out in Warsaw
You hurtin' now, you hurtin' before but bitch I'm a make you more sore
Don't cry now, cry later cause right now it's war
I'm leavin' bodies on the floor
Came through with triple L's, so you know this gun's about four
Came through, yeah, Double XL, never seen man like me before
Came through with two hell dogs, fire comin' straight out the floor
Lord please forgive me for my sins, and hope I make it straight to your door, yeah
Task force, I'm on the field, what the fuck I need the mask for?
I'm dodgin' bullets everywhere, yeah, drugs I transport
It's on my passport, that's J.R.W
.38 magnum, ain't nothin' to cover you, yeah

[Couplet 2 : Mairo]
Yeah, han (Superwak)
J'écris dès le matin, j'résous le dilemme à temps
Le rap s'est pas fermé du cul, han, dis le moi si t'es maton
C'est pas pour les débilos, les 'lauds et les fans de Migos qui causent
Dans ce rap, y a mon flow qui tourne, normal, je suis fier de mes gosses, yeah
J'sers un couplet, j'sors, j'écoute, je kiffe
Si la balle n'a pas touché la cible, j'retourne, je tire
C'est la moindre des choses, j'suis toujours vrai, même si j'fais gaffe
Y a pas d'guten tag, je fais le taff, [? à 4:32] le staff, hein
Cérémonie aux côtés d'un groupe de rock, connu dans toute l'Europe
Photographes à six pour une petite pic' légendaire, deux secondes et mon X est en l'air
Sont plus connus qu'moi mais attends qu'je drop mais même connu, je mettrais pas d'robe
J'veux jamais entendre "Si si patrón", j'suis aussi issu d'l'inmigración
Ha, ils sont sur le macadam, bloqués

Ok, t'es naze, t'as rien à donner
Mhh, à ma guise, analyse bien, banalise rien
Des fois c'est louche quand ta nana elle s'plaint
Pas d'espoir à avoir, faut juste ramasser l'pain, yeah
Chaussettes italiennes, mhh, et une veste d'alien
Elle, c'est pas ta lionne, bitch, c'est une Thee Stallion
Mon flow il est al, mon squad ils est 'auch
C'est comme un fleuve d'eau minérale

J'pourrais faire le tour de la ville à l'envers
By-bo, faut qu'on m'enterre dans l'périmètre, eh
Les années passent, j'change pas de veste
J'développe mon net, j'aiguise mon flair
J'ai mis d'l'ordre dans mes affaires
Préserver l'casier judiciaire
Réinitialiser les paramètres
Maintenant j'fais gaffe quand j'ouvre une f'nêtre
Sur ma tête, j'connais mieux la rue que c'putain d'internet
Garçon, la prudence est d'rigueur
T'avise pas d'traîner dans mon viseur
Vide la caisse fissa, fissa, embarque même le téléviseur
On fait la pluie, le beau temps et on donne l'heure
La police c'est des emmerdes, les iencli c'est du bonheur
Les p'tits frères seuls, les p'tites sœurs

Le rap, le cinéma, tout ça t'as rendu paro
Tu sais plus si t'es dans Scarface ou dans Naruto
Puto, n'essaie pas la fois de trop
Cherche pas à connaître mes défauts
T'inquiète, on fera c'qu'il faut

On a grandi là, j'vais pas mourir ici
Personne perd ici, que du bénéfice
On a grandi là, j'vais pas mourir ici
Quand j'regarde les autres, on dirait j'suis aux States
Quand j'fume trop de jaune, ça monte vite à la tête
On est plus que trois-quatre, on était dix-sept
Raconte pas d'la merde, check qui tire les ficelles
J'suis dans l'périmètre, devant le carrefour
Elle m'a vu, elle attend qu'j'lui fasse la cour
Elle croit qu'elle c'est Aaliyah et moi Shakur
Les iencli, un par un, chacun son tour
J'suis dans l'hôtel, la chambre deux cent quarante-sept
J'vais rouler la batte, arrête de fumer l'cul
J'vais rouler la batte, arrête de fumer l'cul
Il pourrait fumer son doigt si y a plus la quête
Merci pour l'soutien, ["maintenant l'p'tit reuf" ? à 7:37] il sort

Nous y a que des loups, la Lune me rend plus fort

허나 내 맘까지 접은건 아냐EmbedA VIsion of Noble Things LyricsHe slept but for an hour or two, and even then with such disturbance of fitful dreams that he could not be said to rest. At the earliest sound of movements in the house he rose and went out into the morning air. There had fallen a heavy shower just after sunrise, and the glory of the east was still partly veiled with uncertain clouds. Heedless of weather-signs, Sidney strode away at a great pace, urged by his ungovernable thoughts. His state was that miserable one in which a man repeats for the thousandth time something he has said, and torments himself with devising possible and impossible interpretations thereof. Through the night he had done nothing but imagine what significance Jane might have attached to his words about Clara Hewett. Why had he spoken of Clara at all? One moment he understood his reasons, and approved them; the next he was at a loss to account for such needless revival of a miserable story. How had Jane interpreted him? And was it right or wrong to have paused when on the point of confessing that he loved her?

Rain caught him at a distance from home, and he returned to breakfast in rather a cheerless plight. He found that Michael was not feeling quite himself, and would not rise till midday. Jane had a look of anxiety, and he fancied she behaved to him with a constraint hitherto unknown. The fancy was dispelled, however, when, later in the morning, she persuaded him to bring out his sketch-book, and suggested points of view for a drawing of the farm that had been promised to Mr. Pammenter. Himself unable to recover the tone of calm intimacy which till yesterday had been natural between them, Sidney found himself studying the girl, seeking to surprise some proof that she too was no longer the same, and only affected this unconsciousness of change. There was, perhaps, a little less readiness in her eyes to meet his, but she talked as naturally as ever, and the spontaneousness of her good-humour was assuredly not feigned.

On Monday the farmer had business in Maldon. Occasionally when he drove over to that town he took one or other of his children with him to visit a relative, and to-day he proposed that Jane should be of the party. They started after an early dinner. Michael and Sidney stood together in the road, watching the vehicle as it rolled away; then they walked in silence to a familiar spot where they could sit in shadow. Sidney was glad of Jane's departure for the afternoon. He found it impossible to escape the restlessness into which he had fallen, and was resolved to seek relief by opening his mind to the old man. There could be little doubt that Michael already understood his thoughts, and no better opportunity for such a conversation was likely to present itself. When they had been seated for a minute or two, neither speaking, Sidney turned to his companion with a grave look. At the same instant Michael also had raised his eyes and seemed on the point of saying something of importance. They regarded each other. The old man’s face was set in an expression of profound feeling, and his lips moved tremulously before words rose to them.

‘What were you going to say, Sidney?' he asked, reading the other's features.

‘Something which I hope won’t be displeasing to you. I was going to speak of Jane. Since she has been living with you she has grown from a child to a woman. When I was talking with her in the garden on Saturday night I felt this change more distinctly than I had ever done before. I understood that it had made a change in myself. I love her, Mr. Snowdon, and it's my dearest hope that she may come to feel the same for me.'

Michael was more agitated than the speaker; he raised a hand to his forehead and closed his eyes as if the light pained them. But the smile with which he speedily answered Sidney's look of trouble was full of reassurance.
‘You couldn't have said anything that would give me more pleasure,' he replied, just above his breath. ‘Does she know it? Did you speak to her?'

‘We were talking of years ago, and I mentioned Clara Hewett. I said that I had forgotten all about her except that she'd befriended Jane. But nothing more than that. I couldn’t say what I was feeling just then. Partly I thought that it was right to speak to you first; and then—it seemed to me almost as if I should be treating her unfairly. I’m so much older—she knows that it isn't the first time I—and she’s always thought of me just as a friend.'

‘So much older?' repeated Michael, with a grave smile. ‘Why, you're both children to my sight. Wait and let me think a bit, Sidney. I too have something I want to say. I’m glad you've spoken this afternoon, when there's time for us to talk. Just wait a few minutes, and let me think.'

Sidney had as good as forgotten that there was anything unusual in his friend's circumstances; this last day or two he had thought of nothing but Jane and his love for her. Now he recalled the anticipation—originating he scarcely knew how—that some kind of disclosure would before long be made to him. The trouble of his mind was heightened; he waited with all but dread for the next words.

‘I think I've told you,' Michael resumed at length, steadying his voice, ‘that Joseph is my youngest son, and that I had three others. Three others: Michael, Edward, and Robert—all dead. Edward died when he was a boy of fifteen; Robert was killed on the railway—he was a porter—at three-and-twenty. The eldest went out to Australia; he took a wife there, and had one child; the wife died when they'd been married a year or two, and Michael and his boy were drowned, both together. I was living with them at the time, as you know. But what I've never spoken of, Sidney, is that my son had made his fortune. He left a deal of land, and many thousands of pounds, behind him. There was no finding any will; a lawyer in the nearest town, a man that had known him a long time, said he felt sure there'd been no will made. So, as things were, the law gave everything to his father.'

He related it with subdued voice, in a solemn and agitated tone. The effect of the news upon Sidney was a painful constriction of the heart, a rush of confused thought, an involvement of all his perceptions in a sense of fear. The pallor of his cheeks and the pained parting of his lips bore witness to how little he was prepared for such a story.

‘I've begun with what ought by rights to have come last,' pursued Michael, after drawing a deep sigh. ‘But it does me good to get it told; it's been burdening me this long while. Now you must listen, Sidney, whilst I show you why I've kept this a secret. I've no fear but you'll understand me, though most people wouldn't. It's a secret from everybody except a lawyer in London, who does business for me; a right-hearted man he is, in most things, and I'm glad I met with him, but he doesn't understand me as you will; he thinks I'm making a mistake. My son knows nothing about it; at least, it's my hope and belief he doesn't. He told me he hadn't heard of his brother's death. I say I hope he doesn't know; it isn't selfishness, that; I needn't tell you. I've never for a minute thought of myself as a rich man, Sidney; I've never thought of the money as my own, never; and if Joseph proves himself honest, I'm ready to give up to him the share of his brother's property that it seems to me ought to be rightly his, though the law for some reason looks at it in a different way. I'm ready, but I must know that he's an honest man; I must prove him first.'

The eagerness of his thought impelled him to repetitions and emphasis. His voice fell upon a note of feebleness, and with an effort he recovered the tone in which he had begun.

‘As soon as I knew that all this wealth had fallen to me I decided at once to come back to England. What could I do out there? I decided to come to England, but I couldn't see farther ahead than that. I sold all the land; I had the business done for me by that lawyer I spoke of, that had known my son, and he recommended me to a Mr. Percival in London. I came back, and I found little Jane, and then bit by bit I began to understand what my duty was. It got clear in my mind; I formed a purpose, a plan, and it's as strong in me now as ever. Let me think again for a little, Sidney. I want to make it as plain to you as it is to me. You'll understand me best if I go back and tell you more than I have done yet about my life before I left England. Let me think a while.'

He was overcome with a fear that he might not be able to convey with sufficient force the design which had wholly possessed him. So painful was the struggle in him between enthusiasm and a consciousness of failing faculties, that Sidney grasped his hand and begged him to speak simply, without effort.

‘Have no fear about my understanding you. We've talked a great deal together, and I know very well what your strongest motives are. Trust me to sympathise with you.'

‘I do! If I hadn't that trust, Sidney, I couldn't have felt the joy I did when you spoke to me of my Jane. You'll help me to carry out my plan; you and Jane will; you and Jane! I've got to be such an old man all at once, as it seems, and I dursn't have waited much longer without telling you what I had in my mind. See now, I'll go back to when I was a boy, as far back as I can remember. You know I was born in Clerkenwell, and I've told you a little now and then of the hard times I went through. My poor father and mother came out of the country, thinking to better themselves; instead of that, they found nothing but cold and hunger, and toil and moil. They were both dead by when I was between thirteen and fourteen. They died in the same winter—a cruel winter. I used to go about begging bits of firewood from the neighbours. There was a man in our house who kept dogs, and I remember once catching hold of a bit of dirty meat—I can't call it meat—that one of them had gnawed and left on the stairs; and I ate it, as if I'd been a dog myself, I was that driven with hunger. Why, I feel the cold and the hunger at this minute! It was a cruel winter, that, and it left me alone. I had to get my own living as best I could.

‘No teaching. I was nineteen before I could read the signs over shops, or write my own name. Between nineteen and twenty I got all the education I ever was to have, paying a man with what I could save out of my earnings. The blessing was I had health and strength, and with hard struggling I got into a regular employment. At five-and-twenty I could earn my pound a week, pretty certain. When it got to five shillings more, I must needs have a wife to share it with me. My poor girl came to live with me in a room in Hill Street.
I've never spoken to you of her, but you shall hear it all now, cost me what it may in the telling. Of course she was out of a poor home, and she'd known as well as me what it was to go cold and hungry. I sometimes think, Sidney, I can see a look of her in Jane's face—but she was prettier than Jane; yes, yes, prettier than Jane. And to think a man could treat a poor little thing like her the way I did!—you don't know what sort of a man Michael Snowdon was then; no, you don't know what I was then. You're not to think I ill-used her in the common way; I never raised my hand, thank God! and I never spoke a word a man should be ashamed of. But I was a hard, self-willed, stubborn fool. How she came to like me and to marry me, I don't know; we were so different in every way. Well, it was partly my nature and partly what I'd gone through; we hadn't been married more than a month or two when I began to find fault with her, and from that day on she could never please me. I earned five-and-twenty shillings a week, and I'd made up my mind that we must save out of it. I wouldn't let her work; no, what she had to do was to keep the home on as little as possible, and always have everything clean and straight when I got back at night. But Jenny hadn't the same ideas about things as I had. She couldn't pinch and pare, and our plans of saving came to nothing. It grew worse as the children were born. The more need there was for carefulness, the more heedless Jenny seemed to get. And it was my fault, mine from beginning to end. Another man would have been gentle with her and showed her kindly when she was wrong, and have been thankful for the love she gave him, whatever her faults. That wasn't my way. I got angry, and made her life a burden to her. I must have things done exactly as I wished; if not, there was no end to my fault-finding. And yet, if you'll believe it, I loved my wife as truly as man ever did. Jenny couldn't understand that—and how should she? At last she began to deceive me in all sorts of little things; she got into debt with shop-people, she showed me false accounts, she pawned things without my knowing. Last of all, she began to drink. Our fourth child was born just at that time; Jenny had a bad illness, and I believe it set her mind wrong. I lost all control of her, and she used to say if it wasn't for the children she'd go and leave me. One morning we quarrelled very badly, and I did as I'd threatened to—I walked about the streets all the night that followed, never coming home. I went to work next day, but at dinner-time I got frightened and ran home just to speak a word. Little Mike, the eldest, was playing on the stairs, and he said his mother was asleep. I went into the room, and saw Jenny lying on the bed dressed. There was something queer in the way her arms were stretched out. When I got near I saw she was dead. She'd taken poison.

‘And it was I had killed her, just as much as if I'd put the poison to her lips. All because I thought myself such a wise fellow, because I'd resolved to live more prudently than other men of my kind did. I wanted to save money for the future—out of five-and-twenty shillings a week. Many and many a day I starved myself to try and make up for expenses of the home. Sidney, you remember that man we once went to hear lecture, the man that talked of nothing but the thriftlessness of the poor, and how it was their own fault they suffered? I was very near telling you my story when we came away that night. Why, look; I myself was just the kind of poor man that would have suited that lecturer. And what came of it? If I'd let my poor Jenny go her own way from the first, we should have had hard times now and then, but there'd have been our love to help us, and we should have been happy enough. They talk about thriftiness, and it just means that poor people are expected to practise a self-denial that the rich can't even imagine, much less carry out. You know now why this kind of talk always angers me.'

Michael brooded for a few moments, his eyes straying sadly over the landscape before him.

‘I was punished,' he continued, ‘and in the fittest way. The two of my boys who showed most love for me, Edward and Robert, died young. The eldest and youngest were a constant trouble to me. Michael was quick-tempered and self-willed, like myself; I took the wrong way with him, just like I had with his mother, and there was no peace till he left home. Joseph was still harder to deal with; but he's the only one left alive, and there is no need to bring up things against him. With him I wasn't to blame, unless I treated him too kindly and spoilt him. He was my favourite, was Jo, and he repaid me cruelly. When he married, I only heard of it from other people; we'd been parted for a long time already. And just about then I had a letter from Michael, asking me if I was willing to go out and live with him in Australia. I hadn't heard from him more than two or three times in twelve years, and when this letter came to me I was living in Sheffield; I'd been there about five years. He wrote to say he was doing well, and that he didn't like to think of me being left to spend my old age alone. It was a kind letter, and it warmed my heart. Lonely I was; as lonely and sorrowful a man as any in England. I wrote back to say that I'd come to him gladly if he could promise to put me in the way of earning my own living. He agreed to that, and I left the old country, little thinking I should ever see it again. I didn't see Joseph before I went. All I knew of him was, that he lived in Clerkenwell Close, married; and that was all I had to guide me when I tried to find him a few years after. I was bitter against him, and went without trying to say good-bye.

‘My son's fortune seems to have been made chiefly out of horse-dealing and what they call “land-grabbing”—buying sheep-runs over the heads of squatters, to be bought out again at a high profit. Well, you know what my opinion is of trading at the best, and as far as I could understand it, it was trading at about its worst that had filled Michael's pockets. He'd had a partner for a time, and very ugly stories were told me about the man. However, Michael gave me as kind a welcome as his letter promised; prosperity had done him good, and he seemed only anxious to make up for the years of unkindness that had gone by. Had I been willing, I might have lived under his roof at my ease; but I held him to his bargain, and worked like any other man who goes there without money. It's a comfort to me to think of those few years spent in quiet and goodwill with my eldest boy. His own lad would have given trouble, I'm afraid, if he'd lived; Michael used to talk to me uneasily about him, poor fellow! But they both came to their end before the world had parted them.

‘If I'd been a young man, I dare say I should have felt different when they told me how rich I was; it gave me no pleasure at first, and when I'd had time to think about it I only grew worried. I even thought once or twice of getting rid of the burden by giving all the money to a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne. But then I remembered that the poor in the old country had more claim on me, and when I'd got used to the idea of being a wealthy man, I found myself recalling all sorts of fancies and wishes that used to come into my head when I was working hard for a poor living. It took some time to get all the lawyer's business finished, and by when it was done I began to see a way before me. First of all I must find my son in England, and see if he needed help. I hadn't made any change in my way of living, and I came back from Australia as a steerage passenger, wearing the same clothes that I'd worked in. The lawyer laughed at me, but I'm sure I should have laughed at myself if I'd dressed up as a gentleman and begun to play the fool in my old age. The money wasn't to be used in that way. I'd got my ideas, and they grew clearer during the voyage home.

‘You know how I found Jane. Not long after, I put an advertisement in the papers, asking my son, if he saw it, to communicate with Mr. Percival—that's the lawyer I was recommended to in London. There was no answer; Joseph was in America at that time. I hadn't much reason to like Mrs. Peckover and her daughter, but I kept up acquaintance with them because I thought they might hear of Jo some day. And after a while I sent Jane to learn a business. Do you know why I did that? Can you think why I brought up the child as if I'd only had just enough to keep us both, and never gave a sign that I could have made a rich lady of her?'

In asking the question, he bent forward and laid his hand on Sidney's shoulder. His eyes gleamed with that light which betrays the enthusiast, the idealist. As he approached the explanation to which his story had tended, the signs of age and weakness disappeared before the intensity of his feeling. Sidney understood now why he had always been conscious of something in the man's mind that was not revealed to him, of a life-controlling purpose but vaguely indicated by the general tenor of Michael's opinions. The latter's fervour affected him, and he replied with emotion:

‘You wish Jane to think of this money as you do yourself—not to regard it as wealth, but as the means of bringing help to the miserable.'

‘That is my thought, Sidney. It came to me in that form whilst I was sitting by her bed, when she was ill at Mrs. Peckover's. I knew nothing of her character then, and the idea I had might have come to nothing through her turning out untrustworthy. But I thought to myself: Suppose she grows up to be a good woman—suppose I can teach her to look at things in the same way as I do myself, train her to feel that no happiness could be greater than the power to put an end to ever so little of the want and wretchedness about her—suppose when I die I could have the certainty that all this money was going to be used for the good of the poor by a woman who herself belonged to the poor? You understand me? It would have been easy enough to leave it among charities in the ordinary way; but my idea went beyond that. I might have had Jane schooled and fashioned into a lady, and still have hoped that she would use the money well; but my idea went beyond that. There's plenty of ladies nowadays taking an interest in the miserable, and spending their means unselfishly. What I hoped was to raise up for the poor and the untaught a friend out of their own midst, some one who had gone through all that they suffer, who was accustomed to earn her own living by the work of her hands as they do, who had never thought herself their better, who saw the world as they see it and knew all their wants. A lady may do good, we know that; but she can't be the friend of the poor as I understand it; there's too great a distance between her world and theirs. Can you picture to yourself how anxiously I've watched this child from the first day she came to live with me? I've scarcely had a thought but about her. I saw very soon that she had good feelings, and I set myself to encourage them. I wanted her to be able to read and write, but there was no need of any more education than that; it was the heart I cared about, not the mind. Besides, I had always to keep saying to myself that perhaps, after all, she wouldn't turn out the kind of woman I wished, and in that case she mustn't be spoiled for an ordinary life. Sidney, it's this money that has made me a weak old man when I might still have been as strong as many at fifty; the care of it has worn me out; I haven't slept quietly since it came into my hands. But the worst is over. I shan't be disappointed. Jane will be the woman I've hoped for, and however soon my own life comes to an end, I shall die knowing that there's a true man by her side to help her to make my idea a reality.

‘I've mentioned Mr. Percival, the lawyer. He's an old man like myself, and we've had many a long talk together. About a year and a half ago I told him what I've told you now. Since I came back to England he's been managing the money for me; he's paid me the little we needed, and the rest of the income has been used in charity by some people we could trust. Well, Mr. Percival doesn't go with me in my plans for Jane. He thinks I'm making a mistake, that I ought to have had the child educated to fit her to live with rich people. It's no use; I can't get him to feel what a grand thing it'll be for Jane to go about among her own people and help them as nobody ever could. He said to me not long ago, “And isn't the girl ever to have a husband?” It's my hope that she will, I told him. “And do you suppose,” he went on, “that whoever marries her will let her live in the way you talk of? Where are you going to find a working man that'll be content never to touch this money—to work on for his weekly wages, when he might be living at his ease?” And I told him that it wasn't as impossible as he thought. What do you think, Sidney?'

The communication of a noble idea has the same effect upon the brains of certain men—of one, let us say, in every hundred thousand—as a wine that exalts and enraptures. As Sidney listened to the old man telling of his wondrous vision, he became possessed with ardour such as he had known but once or twice in his life. Idealism such as Michael Snowdon had developed in these latter years is a form of genius; given the susceptible hearer, it dazzles, inspires, raises to heroic contempt of the facts of life. Had this story been related to him of some unknown person, Sidney would have admired, but as one admires the nobly impracticable; subject to the electric influence of a man who was great enough to conceive and direct his life by such a project, who could repose so supreme a faith in those he loved, all the primitive nobleness of his character asserted itself, and he could accept with a throbbing heart the superb challenge addressed to him.

‘If Jane can think me worthy to be her husband,' he replied, ‘your friend shall see that he has feared without cause.'
‘I knew it, Sidney; I knew it!' exclaimed the old man. ‘How much younger I feel now that I have shared this burden with you!'

‘And shall you now tell Jane?' the other inquired.

‘Not yet; not just yet. She is very young; we must wait a little. But there can be no reason why you shouldn't speak to her—of yourself.'

Sidney was descending from the clouds. As the flush of his humanitarian enthusiasm passed away, and he thought of his personal relations to Jane, a misgiving, a scruple began to make itself heard within him. Worldly and commonplace the thought, but—had he a right to ask the girl to pledge herself to him under circumstances such as these? To be sure, it was not as if Jane were an heiress in the ordinary way; for all that, would it not be a proceeding of doubtful justice to woo her when as yet she was wholly ignorant of the most important item in her situation? His sincerity was unassailable, but—suppose, in fact, he had to judge the conduct of another man thus placed? Upon the heated pulsing of his blood succeeded a coolness, almost a chill; he felt as though he had been on the verge of a precipice, and had been warned to draw back only just in time. Every second showed him more distinctly what his duty was. He experienced a sensation of thankfulness that he had not spoken definitely on Saturday evening. His instinct had guided him aright; Jane was still too young to be called upon solemnly to decide her whole future.

‘That, too, had better wait, Mr. Snowdon,' he said, after a pause of a minute. ‘I should like her to know everything before I speak to her in that way. In a year it will be time enough.'

Michael regarded him thoughtfully.

‘Perhaps you are right. I wish you knew Mr. Percival; but there is time, there is time. He still thinks I shall be persuaded to alter my plans. That night you came to Hanover Street and found me away, he took me to see a lady who works among the poor in Clerkenwell; she knew me by name, because Mr. Percival had given her money from me to use, but we'd never seen each other till then. He wants me to ask her opinion about Jane.'

‘Has he spoken of her to the lady, do you think?'

‘Oh no!' replied the other, with perfect confidence. ‘He has promised me to keep all that a secret as long as I wish. The lady—her name is Miss Lant—seemed all that my friend said she was, and perhaps Jane might do well to make her acquaintance some day; but that mustn't be till Jane knows and approves the purpose of my life and hers. The one thing that troubles me still, Sidney, is—her father. It's hard that I can't be sure whether my son will be a help or a hindrance. I must wait, and try to know him better.'

The conversation had so wearied Michael, that in returning to the house he had to lean on his companion's arm. Sidney was silent, and yielded, he scarce knew why, to a mood of depression. When Jane returned from Maldon in the evening, and he heard her happy voice as the children ran out to welcome her, there was a heaviness at his heart. Perhaps it came only of hope deferred.Embed陪你 (Be With You) Lyrics陪你 由 池昌旭 (Ji Chang Wook) 歌詞

Tonight SHINee’s in the house woo ho
So give it up, give it up, give it up for SHINee
Give it up, give it up, give it up for SHINee1EmbedUlysses (Chap. 15 - Circe) LyricsThe Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.

THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.


THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!

THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.

(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

CISSY CAFFREY



I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)

THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.

CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.

(She sings.)
I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.

PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!

CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)

She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.


(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.
STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.

(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)

LYNCH So that?

STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!

STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

LYNCH Ba!

STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.

LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)

BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)

BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)

THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?

THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.

BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)

BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)

BLOOM O!

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.

(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.

BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.

RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?

BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.

RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.

RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!

BLOOM Mamma!

ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!

BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

BLOOM Molly!

MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)

MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...

MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.

BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

THE SOAP

We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.


(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

SWENY Three and a penny, please.

BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

MARION (Softly.) Poldy!

BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)

BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)

BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.

BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.

(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

MRS BREEN Mr.

BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!

BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.


(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.

BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.

MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.

MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.

BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.

(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

RICHIE Best value in Dub.

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.

RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!

BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.

MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.

BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?

MRS BREEN Let's.

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

THE BAWD Jewman's melt!

BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.

BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.

BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .

MRS BREEN Too.

BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .

MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!

PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.

THE NAVVY (Shouts.)

We are the boys. Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.

THENAVVY (Shouts.)

The galling chain.
And free our native land.


(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.

(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)

Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.

BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.

(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)

THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.

(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)

FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.

BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)

THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.

BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)

SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.

BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.

FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.

FIRST WATCH Proof.

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)

BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.

FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.

SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.

BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.

MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.

FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.

BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.

SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

FIRST WATCH Regiment.

BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?

BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.

FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.

BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.

BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.


BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.

BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.

BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.

FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.

BLOOM She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!

(General laughter.)

GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.

BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)

Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...


(He is howled down.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

BLOOM A penny in the pound.

(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.

(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.

MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.

BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.

MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!

BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.

BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?

BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.

(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.

(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)

THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)

Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo


(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.

(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)

THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.

THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?

THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.

THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.

FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.

SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.

THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)

THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)

LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?

(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.

(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .

HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.

SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?

PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!

BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.

SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?

FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.

PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.

A VOICE O rocks.

PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.

(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.

PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.

(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!

JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.

(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)

BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?

BLOOM Not I!

ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)

ZOE How's the nuts?

BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.

ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.

BLOOM Not likely.

ZOE I feel it.

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)

BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)

ZOE You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.

BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.

ZOE And you know what thought did?

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?

ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!

BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

BLOOM'S BOYS

The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.


A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.

A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!

(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)

A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?

A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!

A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!

A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.

(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)

THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

ALL God save Leopold the First!

BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.

WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.

MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!

(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.

(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)

JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!

BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!

JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.

A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!

AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.

AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.

BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)

(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)

THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)

THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.


(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)


BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.


BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!


THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!


(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)


BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.


(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)


JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.


PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?


BLOOM Pay them, my friend.


PADDY LEONARD Thank you.


NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?


BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.


J.J. O'MOLLY A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O'Brien!


NOSEY FLYNN Where do I draw the five pounds?

CHRIS CALLINAN What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of Aldebaran?

BLOOM Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.

JOE HYNES Why aren't you in uniform?

BLOOM When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?

BEN DOLLARD Pansies?

BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.

BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?

BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.

LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.

CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.

BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.

ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?

BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.

O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.

DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!

BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?

(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)

FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.

MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!

MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!

NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.

BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)

I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.


HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.

PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!

BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)

LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!

THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.

BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.

THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.

THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)

(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.

MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?

BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.

BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.

BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

A FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?

A HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?

BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!

(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)

THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!


THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

If you see kay

HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)

MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!

(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)

MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.

BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!

(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)

REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.

THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!

BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)

THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!

BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.

(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)

ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.

BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.

ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.

BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.

ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?

ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?

BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.

ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.

BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.

ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.

BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE Babby!

BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.

ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)

THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)

ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.

BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.

ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!

ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?

LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!

ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?

THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!

STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

THE CAP Bah!

STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)

STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!

LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)

FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY No!

ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!

FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)

STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

ALL What?

THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)

FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)

THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)

ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...

THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!

ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.

ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.

STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.

(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)

THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.

ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

LYNCH I'm not looking.

ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)

VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

BLOOM She is rather lean.

VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.

VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.

VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

BLOOM With?...

VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.

BLOOM The stye I dislike.

VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.

(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.

BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?

VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...

VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.

VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.

I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!


(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.

FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.

STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?

FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)

PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?

(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?

FLORRY And the song?

STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.

STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.

ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.

VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!

LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM Poor man!

ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.

BLOOM How?

VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.

KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?

PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.

(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)

LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.

ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.

LYNCH Three wise virgins.

VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.

(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!

A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.

HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.

VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

HENRY All is lost now.

(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.

LYNCH All one and the same God to her.

STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.

STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.

(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

THE CARDINAL

Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.


(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

(The trick doorhandle turns.)

THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

ZOE The devil is in that door.

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)

ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?

ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)

BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.

ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)

THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.

BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.

BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.

THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?

BLOOM Yes. No.

THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.

THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.

BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.

THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.

BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?

THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!

BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!

BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!

BELLO Dungdevourer!

BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.

BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!

BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.

BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.

BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.

FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.

KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.

BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

BELLO (Twisting.) Another!

BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!

BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)

BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)

BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.

ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.

BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.

BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?

BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !

BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.

BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)

BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

A BIDDER A florin!

(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

A VOICE One and eightpence too much.

THE LACQUEY Barang!

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?

BLOOM Eccles Street.

BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!

BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.

BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.

BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...

BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)

SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!

BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.

BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!

BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.

BLOOM They... I

BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...

A VOICE Swear!

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?

(He bites his thumb.)

BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!

BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)

BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)

THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.

VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)

THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.

THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.

THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?

THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.

BLOOM You understood them?

THE YEWS Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!

BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.

(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)

THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!

(They cheer.)

BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO Fool!

THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?

THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.


THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!

BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!

BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)

THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...

BLOOM Done. Prff.

THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?

BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.

BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!

THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.

THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!

BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.

THE WATERFALL

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!

THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)

THE BUTTON Bip!

(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

THE SLUTS

O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.


BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!

THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!

BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !

BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)

BELLA You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.

BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!

BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?

ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)

BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

ZOE

Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.


BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.

STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.

BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.

STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.

BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)

BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!

KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)

FLORRY And me?

LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.

BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.

BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.

ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)

BLOOM This is yours.

STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.

BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.

STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?

STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.

BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM No, but...

STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?

ZOE Is he hungry?

STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)

Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.


ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.

LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)

LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.

(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)

FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.

(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.

ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.

STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE What day were you born?

STEPHEN Thursday. Today.

ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.

FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.

ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?

BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.

BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.

ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.

BLOOM Wrong.

ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?

(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.

(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.

ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?

(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

FLORRY What?

(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)

THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?

(Bronze by gold they whisper.)

ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.

(They whisper again.)

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)

LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.

LENEHAN A good night's work.

BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.

LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!

ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.

BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?

BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?

BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.

MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!

BELLA What? What is it?

(Zoe whispers to her.)

MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.

BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.

BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...

KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!

LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.

BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!

BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!

LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!

BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?

ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.

BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM

(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!

STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.

BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.

LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.

ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous. Misters very selects for is pleasure must to visit heaven and hell show with mortuary candles and they tears silver which occur every night. Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!

LYNCH Vive le vampire!

THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!

STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.

BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...

STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)

BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...

THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!

STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.

ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.

LYNCH Across the world for a wife.

FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.

STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?

BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.

STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!

BLOOM I say, look...

STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!

(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!


(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!

GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!

(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)

STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!

ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY

Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...


ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?

BLOOM Who'll.

LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.

STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?

(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

HOURS You may touch my.

CAVALIERS May I touch your?

HOURS O, but lightly!

CAVALIERS O, so lightly!

THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!

(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!

ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!

MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!

(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

ZOE I'm giddy.

(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)

MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)

MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!

THE PIANOLA

Best, best of all,
Baraabum!


KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!

(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)

STEPHEN Pas seul!

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

THE PIANOLA

Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.


(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)

TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!

SIMON Think of your mother's people!

STEPHEN Dance of death.

(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)

(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)

STEPHEN Ho!

(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

THE CHOIR

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...


(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.


THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.


STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?


BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.


THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.


STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.


THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.


STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.


THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.


STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!


THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!


FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.


BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.


THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!


STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!


THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)


STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)


BLOOM (At the window.) What?


STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!


FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)


THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!


STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!


THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.


STEPHEN Nothung!


(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


THE GASJET Pwfungg!


BLOOM Stop!


LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!


BELLA Police!


(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!


(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)


THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.


ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.


BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.


BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?


A WHORE He tore his coat.


BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.


BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...


BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.


BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...


BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!


BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!


FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?


BELLA Do you want me to call the police?


BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.


BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!


BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.


BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?


ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.


BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!


(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?


STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.


CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.


STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.


VOICES She's faithfultheman.


CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.


PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.


PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.


STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.


CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.


STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...


PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?


STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?


DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.


(He staggers a pace back.)


BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.


STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.


BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.


CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.


BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?


(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.


(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.


STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.


STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.

BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.

STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)

KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

PATRICE Socialiste!

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.

STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!

A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.


THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.


RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.

(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!


PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...

(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?

STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.

CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!

A ROUGH Our men retreated.

PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!

(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)

PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.

STEPHEN Did I? When?

BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.

THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!

(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.

PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)

CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!

CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.

BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!

STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.

PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!

STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.


VOICES Police!

DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.

THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Dooooooooooog!

THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Goooooooooood!

(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)

PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!

BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?

LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)

STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.

BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.

STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.

CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.

BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.

PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.

(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!

THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!

(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)

THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.

BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!

PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!

(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)

FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?

A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.

BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.

BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?

BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

FIRST WATCH Name and address.

(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.

(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.

SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.

BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.

SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)

BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...

(The horse neighs.)

THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)

CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!

THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.

BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)

CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.

BLOOM Night.

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!

STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!

(Murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)

BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!

RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed2019 K-Pop Songs (Alphabetically) LyricsA

[Verse 1: Taeyang, Daesung]
내 친구가 네 얘기를 해
좋아 보였단 말에 괜히 화를 내
어쩌면 아직도 나 땜에 네가
힘들어하길 바랬는지 몰라
요즘 가끔 나도 모르게
우리 같이 즐겨 듣던 노래를 해 (노래를 해)
옛 추억에 잠긴 오늘 같은 날
이유 없이 보고 싶어지는 밤

[Pre-Chorus: Seungri]
그땐 내가 너무 어려서
사랑이 어려워서
널 피하려고만 했지
난 부담이 됐고-우워
불만이 됐죠-우워
끝내 너를 울리고

[Chorus: Taeyang, Daesung, Seungri & T.O.P]
오늘이 지나면 넌 사라질 먼지, 사랑이 뭔지
나 슬퍼 보인다면 내 눈물은 연기, 춤추는 연기
처럼 내일이면 또 아무렇지 않게
하루가 시작돼 널 잊고 살겠죠
그저 네가 행복해지길 나는
이곳에서 남아서 웃으며 빌어 줄게 (Uh)

혹시 기억하니, 우리들 처음 만난 날
순수한 미소 가득히 Sauvignon blanc
널 향한 이유 없는 순종 때론
거침없던 충돌 이별이
운명이란 현실 앞의 내 마지막 분노
마침 들려오는 radio에서
공감되는 사연 지금 내 맘과 똑같다며 (Woo; Ayy)
혹시 네가 아닐까
생각하다 잠이 와
시간은 참 빨리 가 넌 잘 있을까 (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus: Seungri, Daesung]
그땐 내가 너무 어려서
사랑이 어려워서
도망치려고만 했지
결국 부담이 됐고-우워
불만이 됐죠-우워
이젠 늦어 버렸지만

[Bridge: Daesung, Taeyang & sample]
언젠가 길을 지나다
우리 다시 만날 그런 날이 온다면
그 언젠가는 서로 다른 사람과
행복한 모습으로 웃을 수 있게, so long
Love, love

John's father had held the amateur golf championship through many a heated contest; Mrs. Unger was known "from hot-box to hot-bed," as the local phrase went, for her political addresses; and young John T. Unger, who had just turned sixteen, had danced all the latest dances from New York before he put on long trousers. And now, for a certain time, he was to be away from home. That respect for a New England education which is the bane of all provincial places, which drains them yearly of their most promising young men, had seized upon his parents. Nothing would suit them but that he should go to St. Midas' School near Boston-- Hades was too small to hold their darling and gifted son.

Now in Hades--as you know if you ever have been there--the names of the more fashionable preparatory schools and colleges mean very little. The inhabitants have been so long out of the world that, though they make a show of keeping up to date in dress and manners and literature, they depend to a great extent on hearsay, and a function that in Hades would be considered elaborate would doubtless be hailed by a Chicago beef-princess as "perhaps a little tacky."

John T. Unger was on the eve of departure. Mrs. Unger, with maternal fatuity, packed his trunks full of linen suits and electric fans, and Mr. Unger presented his son with an asbestos pocket-book stuffed with money.

"Remember, you are always welcome here," he said. "You can be sure boy, that we'll keep the home fires burning."

"I know," answered John huskily.
"Don't forget who you are and where you come from," continued his father proudly, "and you can do nothing to harm you. You are an Unger--from Hades."

So the old man and the young shook hands and John walked away with tears streaming from his eyes. Ten minutes later he had passed outside the city limits, and he stopped to glance back for the last time. Over the gates the old-fashioned Victorian motto seemed strangely attractive to him. His father had tried time and time again to have it changed to something with a little more push and verve about it, such as "Hades--Your Opportunity," or else a plain "Welcome" sign set over a hearty handshake pricked out in electric lights. The old motto was a little depressing, Mr. Unger had thought--but now....

So John took his look and then set his face resolutely toward his destination. And, as he turned away, the lights of Hades against the sky seemed full of a warm and passionate beauty.

St. Midas' School is half an hour from Boston in a Rolls-Pierce motorcar. The actual distance will never be known, for no one, except John T. Unger, had ever arrived there save in a Rolls-Pierce and probably no one ever will again. St. Midas' is the most expensive and the most exclusive boys' preparatory school in the world.

John's first two years there passed pleasantly. The fathers of all the boys were money-kings and John spent his summers visiting at fashionable resorts. While he was very fond of all the boys he visited, their fathers struck him as being much of a piece, and in his boyish way he often wondered at their exceeding sameness. When he told them where his home was they would ask jovially, "Pretty hot down there?" and John would muster a faint smile and answer, "It certainly is." His response would have been heartier had they not all made this joke--at best varying it with, "Is it hot enough for you down there?" which he hated just as much.

In the middle of his second year at school, a quiet, handsome boy named Percy Washington had been put in John's form. The newcomer was pleasant in his manner and exceedingly well dressed even for St. Midas', but for some reason he kept aloof from the other boys. The only person with whom he was intimate was John T. Unger, but even to John he was entirely uncommunicative concerning his home or his family. That he was wealthy went without saying, but beyond a few such deductions John knew little of his friend, so it promised rich confectionery for his curiosity when Percy invited him to spend the summer at his home "in the West." He accepted, without hesitation.

It was only when they were in the train that Percy became, for the first time, rather communicative. One day while they were eating lunch in the dining-car and discussing the imperfect characters of several of the boys at school, Percy suddenly changed his tone and made an abrupt remark.

"My father," he said, "is by far the richest man in the world."

"Oh," said John, politely. He could think of no answer to make to this confidence. He considered "That's very nice," but it sounded hollow and was on the point of saying, "Really?" but refrained since it would seem to question Percy's statement. And such an astounding statement could scarcely be questioned.

"By far the richest," repeated Percy.

"I was reading in the World Almanac," began John, "that there was one man in America with an income of over five million a year and four men with incomes of over three million a year, and--"

"Oh, they're nothing." Percy's mouth was a half-moon of scorn. "Catchpenny capitalists, financial small-fry, petty merchants and money-lenders. My father could buy them out and not know he'd done it."

"But how does he--"
"Why haven't they put down his income tax? Because he doesn't pay any. At least he pays a little one--but he doesn't pay any on his real income."

"He must be very rich," said John simply. "I'm glad. I like very rich people.

"The richer a fella is, the better I like him." There was a look of passionate frankness upon his dark face. "I visited the Schnlitzer-Murphys last Easter. Vivian Schnlitzer-Murphy had rubies as big as hen's eggs, and sapphires that were like globes with lights inside them--"

"I love jewels," agreed Percy enthusiastically. "Of course I wouldn't want any one at school to know about it, but I've got quite a collection myself I used to collect them instead of stamps."

"And diamonds," continued John eagerly. "The Schnlitzer-Murphys had diamonds as big as walnuts--"

"That's nothing." Percy had leaned forward and dropped his voice to a low whisper. "That's nothing at all. My father has a diamond bigger than the Ritz-Carlton Hotel."

II

THE MONTANA sunset lay between two mountains like a gigantic bruise from which dark arteries spread themselves over a poisoned sky. An immense distance under the sky crouched the village of Fish, minute, dismal, and forgotten. There were twelve men, so it was said, in the village of Fish, twelve somber and inexplicable souls who sucked a lean milk from the almost literally bare rock upon which a mysterious populatory force had begotten them. They had become a race apart, these twelve men of Fish, like some species developed by an early whim of nature, which on second thought had abandoned them to struggle and extermination.
Out of the blue-black bruise in the distance crept a long line of moving lights upon the desolation of the land, and the twelve men of Fish gathered like ghosts at the shanty depot to watch the passing of the seven o'clock train, the Transcontinental Express from Chicago. Six times or so a year the Transcontinental Express, through some inconceivable jurisdiction, stopped at the village of Fish, and when this occurred a figure or so would disembark, mount into a buggy that always appeared from out of the dusk, and drive off toward the bruised sunset. The observation of this pointless and preposterous phenomenon had become a sort of cult among the men of Fish. To observe, that was all; there remained in them none of the vital quality of illusion which would make them wonder or speculate, else a religion might have grown up around these mysterious visitations. But the men of Fish were beyond all religion--the barest and most savage tenets of even Christianity could gain no foothold on that barren rock--so there was no altar, no priest, no sacrifice; only each night at seven the silent concourse by the shanty depot, a congregation who lifted up a prayer of dim, anaemic wonder.

On this June night, the Great Brakeman, whom, had they deified any one, they might well have chosen as their celestial protagonist, had ordained that the seven o'clock train should leave its human (or inhuman) deposit at Fish. At two minutes after seven Percy Washington and John T. Unger disembarked, hurried past the spellbound, the agape, the fearsome eyes of the twelve men of Fish, mounted into a buggy which had obviously appeared from nowhere, and drove away.

After half an hour, when the twilight had coagulated into dark, the silent negro who was driving the buggy hailed an opaque body somewhere ahead of them in the gloom. In response to his cry, it turned upon them a luminous disk which regarded them like a malignant eye out of the unfathomable night. As they came closer, John saw that it was the tail-light of an immense automobile, larger and more magnificent than any he had ever seen. Its body was of gleaming metal richer than nickel and lighter than silver, and the hubs of the wheels were studded with iridescent geometric figures of green and yellow--John did not dare to guess whether they were glass or jewel.

Two negroes, dressed in glittering livery such as one sees in pictures of royal processions in London, were standing at attention beside the car and as the two young men dismounted from the buggy they were greeted in some language which the guest could not understand, but which seemed to be an extreme form of the Southern negro's dialect.

"Get in," said Percy to his friend, as their trunks were tossed to the ebony roof of the limousine. "Sorry we had to bring you this far in that buggy, but of course it wouldn't do for the people on the train or those Godforsaken fellas in Fish to see this automobile."

"Gosh! What a car!" This ejaculation was provoked by its interior. John saw that the upholstery consisted of a thousand minute and exquisite tapestries of silk, woven with jewels and embroideries, and set upon a background of cloth of gold. The two armchair seats in which the boys luxuriated were covered with stuff that resembled duvetyn, but seemed woven in numberless colors of the ends of ostrich feathers.
"What a car!" cried John again, in amazement.

"This thing?" Percy laughed. "Why, it's just an old junk we use for a station wagon."

By this time they were gliding along through the darkness toward the break between the two mountains.

"We'll be there in an hour and a half," said Percy, looking at the clock. "I may as well tell you it's not going to be like anything you ever saw before."

If the car was any indication of what John would see, he was prepared to be astonished indeed. The simple piety prevalent in Hades has the earnest worship of and respect for riches as the first article of its creed--had John felt otherwise than radiantly humble before them, his parents would have turned away in horror at the blasphemy.

They had now reached and were entering the break between the two mountains and almost immediately the way became much rougher.

"If the moon shone down here, you'd see that we're in a big gulch," said Percy, trying to peer out of the window. He spoke a few words into the mouthpiece and immediately the footman turned on a search-light and swept the hillsides with an immense beam.

"Rocky, you see. An ordinary car would be knocked to pieces in half an hour. In fact, it'd take a tank to navigate it unless you knew the way. You notice we're going uphill now."

They were obviously ascending, and within a few minutes the car was crossing a high rise, where they caught a glimpse of a pale moon newly risen in the distance. The car stopped suddenly and several figures took shape out of the dark beside it--these were negroes also. Again the two young men were saluted in the same dimly recognizable dialect; then the negroes set to work and four immense cables dangling from overhead were attached with hooks to the hubs of the great jeweled wheels. At a resounding "Hey-yah!" John felt the car being lifted slowly from the ground-- up and up--clear of the tallest rocks on both sides--then higher, until he could see a wavy, moonlit valley stretched out before him in sharp contrast to the quagmire of rocks that they had just left. Only on one side was there still rock--and then suddenly there was no rock beside them or anywhere around.

It was apparent that they had surmounted some immense knife-blade of stone, projecting perpendicularly into the air. In a moment they were going down again, and finally with a soft bump they were landed upon the smooth earth.

"The worst is over," said Percy, squinting out the window. "It's only five miles from here, and our own road--tapestry brick--all the way. This belongs to us. This is where the United States ends, father says."

"Are we in Canada?"

"We are not. We're in the middle of the Montana Rockies. But you are now on the only five square miles of land in the country that's never been surveyed."

"Why hasn't it? Did they forget it?"

"No," said Percy, grinning, "they tried to do it three times. The first time my grandfather corrupted a whole department of the State survey; the second time he had the official maps of the United States tinkered with--that held them for fifteen years. The last time was harder. My father fixed it so that their compasses were in the strongest magnetic field ever artificially set up. He had a whole set of surveying instruments made with a slight defection that would allow for this territory not to appear, and he substituted them for the ones that were to be used. Then he had a river deflected and he had what looked like a village built up on its banks--so that they'd see it, and think it was a town ten miles farther up the valley. There's only one thing my father's afraid of," he concluded, "only one thing in the world that could be used to find us out."

"What's that?"

Percy sank his voice to a whisper.

"Aeroplanes," he breathed. "We've got half a dozen anti-aircraft guns and we've arranged it so far--but there've been a few deaths and a great many prisoners. Not that we mind that, you know, father and I, but it upsets mother and the girls, and there's always the chance that some time we won't be able to arrange it."

Shreds and tatters of chinchilla, courtesy clouds in the green moon's heaven, were passing the green moon like precious Eastern stuffs paraded for the inspection of some Tartar Khan. It seemed to John that it was day, and that he was looking at some lads sailing above him in the air, showering down tracts and patent medicine circulars, with their messages of hope for despairing, rockbound hamlets. It seemed to him that he could see them look down out of the clouds and stare--and stare at whatever there was to stare at in this place whither he was bound--What then? Were they induced to land by some insidious device there to be immured far from patent medicines and from tracts until the judgment day--or, should they fail to fall into the trap, did a quick puff of smoke and the sharp round of a splitting shell bring them drooping to earth--and "upset" Percy's mother and sisters. John shook his head and the wraith of a hollow laugh issued silently from his parted lips. What desperate transaction lay hidden here? What moral expedient of a bizarre Croesus? What terrible and golden mystery? . . .

The chinchilla clouds had drifted past now and outside the Montana night was bright as day. The tapestry brick of the road was smooth to the tread of the great tires as they rounded a still, moonlit lake; they passed into darkness for a moment, a pine grove, pungent and cool, then they came out into a broad avenue of lawn and John's exclamation of pleasure was simultaneous with Percy's taciturn "We're home."

Full in the light of the stars, an exquisite ch_teau rose from the borders of the lake, climbed in marble radiance half the height of an adjoining mountain, then melted in grace, in perfect symmetry, in translucent feminine languor, into the massed darkness of a forest of pine. The many towers, the slender tracery of the sloping parapets, the chiselled wonder of a thousand yellow windows with their oblongs and hectagons and triangles of golden light, the shattered softness of the intersecting planes of star-shine and blue shade, all trembled on John's spirit like a chord of music. On one of the towers, the tallest, the blackest at its base, an arrangement of exterior lights at the top made a sort of floating fairyland--and as John gazed up in warm enchantment the faint acciaccare sound of violins drifted down in a rococo harmony that was like nothing he had ever heard before. Then in a moment the car stopped before wide, high marble steps around which the night air was fragrant with a host of flowers. At the top of the steps two great doors swung silently open and amber light flooded out upon the darkness, silhouetting the figure of an exquisite lady with black, high-piled hair, who held out her arms toward them.

"Mother," Percy was saying, "this is my friend, John Unger, from Hades."

Afterward John remembered that first night as a daze of many colors, of quick sensory impressions, of music soft as a voice in love, and of the beauty of things, lights and shadows, and motions and faces. There was a whitehaired man who stood drinking a many-hued cordial from a crystal thimble set on a golden stem. There was a girl with a flowery face, dressed like Titania with braided sapphires in her hair. There was a room where the solid, soft gold of the walls yielded to the pressure of his hand, and a room that was like a platonic conception of the ultimate prism--ceiling, floor, and all, it was lined with an unbroken mass of diamonds, diamonds of every size and shape, until, lit with tall violet lamps in the corners, it dazzled the eyes with a whiteness that could be compared only with itself, beyond human wish or dream.

Through a maze of these rooms the two boys wandered. Sometimes the floor under their feet would flame in brilliant patterns from lighting below, patterns of barbaric clashing colors, of pastel delicacy, of sheer whiteness, or of subtle and intricate mosaic, surely from some mosque on the Adriatic Sea. Sometimes beneath layers of thick crystal he would see blue or green water swirling, inhabited by vivid fish and growths of rainbow foliage. Then they would be treading on furs of every texture and color or along corridors of palest ivory, unbroken as though carved complete from the gigantic tusks of dinosaurs extinct before the age of man. . . .

Then a hazily remembered transition, and they were at dinner--where each plate was of two almost imperceptible layers of solid diamond between which was curiously worked a filigree of emerald design, a shaving sliced from green air. Music, plangent and unobtrusive, drifted down through far corridors--his chair, feathered and curved insidiously to his back, seemed to engulf and overpower him as he drank his first glass of port. He tried drowsily to answer a question that had been asked him, but the honeyed luxury that clasped his body added to the illusion of sleep--jewels, fabrics, wines, and metals blurred before his eyes into a sweet mist. . . .

"Yes," he replied with a polite effort, "it certainly is hot enough for me down there."

He managed to add a ghostly laugh; then, without movement, without resistance, he seemed to float off and away, leaving an iced dessert that was pink as a dream. . . . He fell asleep.

When he awoke he knew that several hours had passed. He was in a great quiet room with ebony walls and a dull illumination that was too faint, too subtle, to be called a light. His young host was standing over him.

"You fell asleep at dinner," Percy was saying. "I nearly did, too--it was such a treat to be comfortable again after this year of school. Servants undressed and bathed you while you were sleeping."

"Is this a bed or a cloud?" sighed John. "Percy, Percy--before you go, I want to apologize."

"For what?"

"For doubting you when you said you had a diamond as big as the Ritz-Carlton Hotel."

Percy smiled.

"I thought you didn't believe me. It's that mountain, you know."

"What mountain?"

"The mountain the ch_teau rests on. It's not very big, for a mountain. But except about fifty feet of sod and gravel on top it's solid diamond.One diamond, one cubic mile without a flaw. Aren't you listening? Say----"

But John T. Unger had again fallen asleep.

III

MORNING. As he awoke he perceived drowsily that the room had at the same moment become dense with sunlight. The ebony panels of one wall had slid aside on a sort of track, leaving his chamber half open to the day. A large negro in a white uniform stood beside his bed.
"Good-evening," muttered John, summoning his brains from the wild places.

"Good-morning, sir. Are you ready for your bath, sir? Oh, don't get up--I'll put you in, if you'll just unbutton your pajamas--there. Thank you, sir."

John lay quietly as his pajamas were removed--he was amused and delighted; he expected to be lifted like a child by this black Gargantua who was tending him, but nothing of the sort happened; instead he felt the bed tilt up slowly on its side--he began to roll, startled at first, in the direction of the wall, but when he reached the wall its drapery gave way, and sliding two yards farther down a fleecy incline he plumped gently into water the same temperature as his body.

He looked about him. The runway or rollway on which he had arrived had folded gently back into place. He had been projected into another chamber and was sitting in a sunken bath with his head just above the level of the floor. All about him, lining the walls of the room and the sides and bottom of the bath itself, was a blue aquarium, and gazing through the crystal surface on which he sat, he could see fish swimming among amber lights and even gliding without curiosity past his outstretched toes, which were separated from them only by the thickness of the crystal. From overhead, sunlight came down through sea-green glass.

I suppose, sir, that you'd like hot rosewater and soapsuds this morning sir--and perhaps cold salt water to finish."

The negro was standing beside him.

"Yes," agreed John, smiling inanely, "as you please." Any idea of ordering this bath according to his own meager standards of living would have been priggish and not a little wicked.

The negro pressed a button and a warm rain began to fall, apparently from overhead, but really, so John discovered after a moment, from a fountain arrangement near by. The water turned to a pale rose color and jets of liquid soap spurted into it from four miniature walrus heads at the corners of the bath. In a moment a dozen little paddle-wheels, fixed to the sides, had churned the mixture into a radiant rainbow of pink foam which enveloped him softly with its delicious lightness, and burst in shining, rosy bubbles here and there about him.

"Shall I turn on the moving-picture machine, sir?" suggested the negro deferentially. "There's a good one-reel comedy in this machine to-day, or can put in a serious piece in a moment, if you prefer it."

"No, thanks," answered John, politely but firmly. He was enjoying his at too much to desire any distraction. But distraction came. In a moment he was listening intently to the sound of flutes from just outside, flutes ripping a melody that was like a waterfall, cool and green as the room itself, accompanying a frothy piccolo, in play more fragile than the lace of u s that covered and charmed him.

After a cold salt-water bracer and a cold fresh finish, he stepped out and into a fleecy robe, and upon a couch covered with the same material he was rubbed with oil, alcohol, and spice. Later he sat in a voluptuous chair while he was shaved and his hair was trimmed.

"Mr. Percy is waiting in your sitting-room," said the negro, when these operations were finished. "My name is Gygsum, Mr. Unger, sir. I am to see to Mr. Unger every morning."

John walked out into the brisk sunshine of his living-room, where he found breakfast waiting for him and Percy, gorgeous in white kid knickerbockers, smoking in an easy chair.

IV

THIS IS A STORY of the Washington family as Percy sketched it for John during breakfast.
The father of the present Mr. Washington had been a Virginian, a direct descendant of George Washington, and Lord Baltimore. At the close of the Civil War he was a twenty-five-year-old Colonel with a played-out plantation and about a thousand dollars in gold.

Fitz-Norman Culpepper Washington, for that was the young Colonel's name, decided to present the Virginia estate to his younger brother and go West. He selected two dozen of the most faithful blacks, who, of course, worshipped him, and bought twenty-five tickets to the West, where he intended to take out land in their names and start a sheep and cattle ranch.

When he had been in Montana for less than a month and things were going very poorly indeed, he stumbled on his great discovery. He had lost his way when riding in the hills, and after a day without food he began to grow hungry. As he was without his rifle, he was forced to pursue a squirrel, and in the course of the pursuit he noticed that it was carrying something shiny in its mouth. Just before it vanished into its hole--for Providence did not intend that this squirrel should alleviate his hunger--it dropped its burden. Sitting down to consider the situation Fitz-Norman's eye was caught by a gleam in the grass beside him. In ten seconds he had completely lost his appetite and gained one hundred thousand dollars. The squirrel, which had refused with annoying persistence to become food, had made him a present of a large and perfect diamond.

Late that night he found his way to camp and twelve hours later all the males among his darkies were back by the squirrel hole digging furiously at the side of the mountain. He told them he had discovered a rhinestone mine, and, as only one or two of them had ever seen even a small diamond before, they believed him, without question. When the magnitude of his discovery became apparent to him, he found himself in a quandary. The mountain was a diamond--it was literally nothing else but solid diamond. He filled four saddle bags full of glittering samples and started on horseback for St. Paul. There he managed to dispose of half a dozen small stones--when he tried a larger one a storekeeper fainted and Fitz-Norman was arrested as a public disturber. He escaped from jail and caught the train for New York, where he sold a few medium-sized diamonds and received in exchange about two hundred thousand dollars in gold. But he did not dare to produce any exceptional gems--in fact, he left New York just in time. Tremendous excitement had been created in jewelry circles, not so much by the size of his diamonds as by their appearance in the city from mysterious sources. Wild rumors became current that a diamond mine had been discovered in the Catskills, on the Jersey coast, on Long Island, beneath Washington Square. Excursion trains, packed with men carrying picks and shovels, began to leave New York hourly, bound for various neighboring El Dorados. But by that time young Fitz-Norman was on his way back to Montana.

By the end of a fortnight he had estimated that the diamond in the mountain was approximately equal in quantity to all the rest of the diamonds known to exist in the world. There was no valuing it by any regular computation, however, for it was one solid diamond--and if it were offered for sale not only would the bottom fall out of the market, but also, if the value should vary with its size in the usual arithmetical progression, there would not be enough gold in the world to buy a tenth part of it. And what could any one do with a diamond that size?

It was an amazing predicament. He was, in one sense, the richest man that ever lived--and yet was he worth anything at all? If his secret should transpire there was no telling to what measures the Government might resort in order to prevent a panic, in gold as well as in jewels. They might take over the claim immediately and institute a monopoly.

There was no alternative--he must market his mountain in secret. He sent South for his younger brother and put him in charge of his colored following--darkies who had never realized that slavery was abolished. To make sure of this, he read them a proclamation that he had composed, which announced that General Forrest had reorganized the shattered Southern armies and defeated the North in one pitched battle. The negroes believed him implicitly. They passed a vote declaring it a good thing and held revival services immediately.

Fitz-Norman himself set out for foreign parts with one hundred thousand dollars and two trunks filled with rough diamonds of all sizes. He sailed for Russia in a Chinese junk and six months after his departure from Montana he was in St. Petersburg. He took obscure lodgings and called immediately upon the court jeweller, announcing that he had a diamond for the Czar. He remained in St. Petersburg for two weeks, in constant danger of being murdered, living from lodging to lodging, and afraid to visit his trunks more than three or four times during the whole fortnight.

On his promise to return in a year with larger and finer stones, he was allowed to leave for India. Before he left, however, the Court Treasurers had deposited to his credit, in American banks, the sum of fifteen million dollars--under four different aliases.

He returned to America in 1868, having been gone a little over two years. He had visited the capitals of twenty-two countries and talked with five emperors, eleven kings, three princes, a shah, a khan, and a sultan. At that time Fitz-Norman estimated his own wealth at one billion dollars. One fact worked consistently against the disclosure of his secret. No one of his larger diamonds remained in the public eye for a week before being invested with a history of enough fatalities, amours, revolutions, and wars to have occupied it from the days of the first Babylonian Empire.

From 1870 until his death in 1900, the history of Fitz-Norman Washington was a long epic in gold. There were side issues, of course--he evaded the surveys, he married a Virginia lady, by whom he had a single son, and he was compelled, due to a series of unfortunate complications, to murder his brother, whose unfortunate habit of drinking himself into an indiscreet stupor had several times endangered their safety. But very few other murders stained these happy years of progress and expansion.

Just before he died he changed his policy, and with all but a few million dollars of his outside wealth bought up rare minerals in bulk, which he deposited in the safety vaults of banks all over the world, marked as bric-_-brac. His son, Braddock Tarleton Washington, followed this policy on an even more tensive scale. The minerals were converted into the rarest of all elements--radium--so that the equivalent of a billion dollars in gold could be placed in a receptacle no bigger than a cigar box.

When Fitz-Norman had been dead three years his son, Braddock, decided that the business had gone far enough. The amount of wealth that he and his father had taken out of the mountain was beyond all exact computation. He kept a note-book in cipher in which he set down the approximate quantity of radium in each of the thousand banks he patronized, and recorded the alias under which it was held. Then he did a very simple thing--he sealed up the mine.

He sealed up the mine. What had been taken out of it would support all the Washingtons yet to be born in unparalleled luxury for generations. His one care must be the protection of his secret, lest in the possible panic attendant on its discovery he should be reduced with all the property-holders in the world to utter poverty.

This was the family among whom John T. Unger was staying. This was the story he heard in his silver-walled living-room the morning after his arrival.

IV

AFTER BREAKFAST, John found his way out the great marble entrance and looked curiously at the scene before him. The whole valley, from the diamond mountain to the steep granite cliff five miles away, still gave off a breath of golden haze which hovered idly above the fine sweep of lawns and lakes and gardens. Here and there clusters of elms made delicate groves of shade, contrasting strangely with the tough masses of pine forest that held the hills in a grip of dark-blue green. Even as John looked he saw three fawns in single file patter out from one clump about a half mile away and disappear with awkward gayety into the black-ribbed half-light of another. John would not have been surprised to see a goat-foot piping his way among the trees or to catch a glimpse of pink nymph-skin and flying yellow hair between the greenest of the green leaves.
In some such cool hope he descended the marble steps, disturbing faintly the sleep of two silky Russian wolfhounds at the bottom, and set off along a walk of white and blue brick that seemed to lead in no particular direction.

He was enjoying himself as much as he was able. It is youth's felicity as well as its insufficiency that it can never live in the present, but must always be measuring up the day against its own radiantly imagined future--flowers and gold, girls and stars, they are only prefigurations and prophecies of that incomparable, unattainable young dream.

John rounded a soft corner where the massed rose-bushes filled the air with heavy scent, and struck off across a park toward a patch of moss under some trees. He had never lain upon moss, and he wanted to see whether it was really soft enough to justify the use of its name as an adjective. Then he saw a girl coming toward him over the grass. She was the most beautiful person he had ever seen

She was dressed in a white little gown that came just below her knees, and a wreath of mignonettes clasped with blue slices of sapphire bound up her hair. Her pink bare feet scattered the dew before them as she came. She was younger than John--not more than sixteen.

"Hello," she cried softly, "I'm Kismine."

She was much more than that to John already. He advanced toward her, scarcely moving as he drew near lest he should tread on her bare toes.

"You haven't met me," said her soft voice. Her blue eyes added, "Oh, but you've missed a great deal!" . . . "You met my sister, Jasmine, last night. I was sick with lettuce poisoning," went on her soft voice, and her eyes continued, "and when I'm sick I'm sweet--and when I'm well."

"You have made an enormous impression on me," said John's eyes, "and I'm not so slow myself"--"How do you do?" said his voice. "I hope you're better this morning."--"You darling," added his eyes tremulously.

John observed that they had been walking along the path. On her suggestion they sat down together upon the moss, the softness of which he failed to determine.

He was critical about women. A single defect--a thick ankle, a hoarse voice, a glass eye--was enough to make him utterly indifferent. And here for the first time in his life he was beside a girl who seemed to him the incarnation of physical perfection.

"Are you from the East?" asked Kismine with charming interest.

"No," answered John simply. "I'm from Hades."

Either she had never heard of Hades, or she could think of no pleasant comment to make upon it, for she did not discuss it further.

"I'm going East to school this fall," she said. "D'you think I'll like it? I'm going to New York to Miss Bulge's. It's very strict, but you see over the weekends I'm going to live at home with the family in our New York house, because father heard that the girls had to go walking two by two."

"Your father wants you to be proud," observed John.

"We are," she answered, her eyes shining with dignity."None of us has ever been punished. Father said we never should be. Once when my sister Jasmine was a little girl she pushed him down-stairs and he just got up and limped away.

"Mother was--well, a little startled," continued Kismine, "when she heard that you were from--from where you are from, you know. She said that when she was a young girl--but then, you see, she's a Spaniard and old-fashioned."

"Do you spend much time out here?" asked John, to conceal the fact that he was somewhat hurt by this remark. It seemed an unkind allusion to his provincialism.

"Percy and Jasmine and I are here every summer, but next summer Jasmine is going to Newport. She's coming out in London a year from this fall. She'll be presented at court."

"Do you know, " began John hesitantly, "you're much more sophisticated than I thought you were when I first saw you?"

"Oh, no, I'm not," she exclaimed hurriedly. "Oh, I wouldn't think of being. I think that sophisticated young people are terriblycommon, don't you? I'm not at all, really. If you say I am, I'm going to cry."

She was so distressed that her lip was trembling. John was impelled to protest:

I didn't mean that; I only said it to tease you."

"Because I wouldn't mind if I were," she persisted. "but I'm not. I'm very innocent and girlish. I never smoke, or drink, or read anything except poetry. I know scarcely any mathematics or chemistry. I dress very simply--in fact, I scarcely dress at all. I think sophisticated is the last thing you can say about me. I believe that girls ought to enjoy their youths in a wholesome way."

"I do, too," said John heartily.

Kismine was cheerful again. She smiled at him, and a still-born tear dripped from the corner of one blue eye.

"I like you," she whispered, intimately. "Are you going to spend all your time with Percy while you're here, or will you be nice to me. Just think--I'm absolutely fresh ground. I've never had a boy in love with me in all my life. I've never been allowed even to see boys alone--except Percy. I came all the way out here into this grove hoping to run into you, where the family wouldn't be around.

Deeply flattered, John bowed from the hips as he had been taught at dancing school in Hades.

"We'd better go now," said Kismine sweetly. "I have to be with mother at eleven. You haven't asked me to kiss you once. I thought boys always did that nowadays."

John drew himself up proudly.

"Some of them do," he answered, "but not me. Girls don't do that sort of thing--in Hades."

Side by side they walked back toward the house.

VI

JOHN STOOD facing Mr. Braddock Washington in the full sunlight. The elder man was about forty with a proud, vacuous face, intelligent eyes, and a robust figure. In the mornings he smelt of horses--the best horses. He carried a plain walking-stick of gray birch with a single large opal for a grip. He and Percy were showing John around.
"The slaves' quarters are there." His walking-stick indicated a cloister of marble on their left that ran in graceful Gothic along the side of the mountain. "In my youth I was distracted for a while from the business of life by a period of absurd idealism. During that time they lived in luxury. For instance, I equipped every one of their rooms with a tile bath."

"I suppose," ventured John, with an ingratiating laugh, "that they used the bathtubs to keep coal in. Mr. Schnlitzer-Murphy told me that once he----"

"The opinions of Mr. Schnlitzer-Murphy are of little importance, I should imagine," interrupted Braddock Washington, coldly. "My slaves did not keep coal in their bathtubs. They had orders to bathe every day, and they did. If they hadn't I might have ordered a sulphuric acid shampoo. I discontinued the baths for quite another reason. Several of them caught cold and died. Water is not good for certain races--except as a beverage."

John laughed, and then decided to nod his head in sober agreement. Braddock Washington made him uncomfortable.

"All these negroes are descendants of the ones my father brought North with him. There are about two hundred and fifty now. You notice that they've lived so long apart from the world that their original dialect has become an almost indistinguishable patois. We bring a few of them up to speak English--my secretary and two or three of the house servants.

"This is the golf course," he continued, as they strolled along the velvet winter grass. "It's all a green, you see--no fairway, no rough, no hazards."

He smiled pleasantly at John.

"Many men in the cage, father?" asked Percy suddenly.

Braddock Washington stumbled, and let forth an involuntary curse.

"One less than there should be," he ejaculated darkly--and then added after a moment, "We've had difficulties."

"Mother was telling me," exclaimed Percy, "that Italian teacher----"

"A ghastly error," said Braddock Washington angrily. "But of course there's a good chance that we may have got him. Perhaps he fell somewhere in the woods or stumbled over a cliff. And then there's always the probability that if he did get away his story wouldn't be believed. Nevertheless, I've had two dozen men looking for him in different towns around here."

"And no luck?"

"Some. Fourteen of them reported to my agent that they'd each killed a man answering to that description, but of course it was probably only the reward they were after----"

He broke off. They had come to a large cavity in the earth about the circumference of a merry-go-round and covered by a strong iron grating. Braddock Washington beckoned to John, and pointed his cane down through the grating. John stepped to the edge and gazed. Immediately his ears were assailed by a wild clamor from below.

"Come on down to Hell!"

"Hello, kiddo, how's the air up there?"

"Hey! Throw us a rope!"

"Got an old doughnut, Buddy, or a couple of second-hand sandwiches?"

"Say, fella, if you'll push down that guy you're with, we'll show you a quick disappearance scene."

"Paste him one for me, will you?"

It was too dark to see clearly into the pit below, but John could tell from the coarse optimism and rugged vitality of the remarks and voices that they proceeded from middle-class Americans of the more spirited type. Then Mr. Washington put out his cane and touched a button in the grass, and the scene below sprang into light.

"These are some adventurous mariners who had the misfortune to discover El Dorado," he remarked.

Below them there had appeared a large hollow in the earth shaped like the interior of a bowl. The sides were steep and apparently of polished glass, and on its slightly concave surface stood about two dozen men clad in the half costume, half uniform, of aviators. Their upturned faces, lit with wrath with malice, with despair, with cynical humor, were covered by long growths of beard, but with the exception of a few who had pined perceptibly away, they seemed to be a well-fed, healthy lot.

Braddock Washington drew a garden chair to the edge of the pit and sat down.

"Well, how are you, boys?" he inquired genially.

A chorus of execration in which all joined except a few too dispirited to cry out, rose up into the sunny air, but Braddock Washington heard it with unruffled composure. When its last echo had died away he spoke again.

"Have you thought up a way out of your difficulty?"

From here and there among them a remark floated up.

"We decided to stay here for love!"

"Bring us up there and we'll find us a way!"

Braddock Washington waited until they were again quiet. Then he said:

"I've told you the situation. I don't want you here. I wish to heaven I'd never seen you. Your own curiosity got you here, and any time that you can think of a way out which protects me and my interests I'll be glad to consider it. But so long as you confine your efforts to digging tunnels--yes, I know about the new one you've started--you won't get very far. This isn't as hard on you as you make it out, with all your howling for the loved ones at home. If you were the type who worried much about the loved ones at home, you'd never have taken up aviation."

A tall man moved apart from the others, and held up his hand to call his captor's attention to what he was about to say.

"Let me ask you a few questions!" he cried. "You pretend to be a fair-minded man."

"How absurd. How could a man of my position be fair-minded toward you? You might as well speak of a Spaniard being fair-minded toward a piece of steak."

At this harsh observation the faces of the two dozen steaks fell, but the tall man continued:

"All right!" he cried. "We've argued this out before. You're not a humanitarian and you're not fair-minded, but you're human--at least you say you are--and you ought to be able to put yourself in our place for long enough to think how--how--how----

"How what?" demanded Washington, coldly.

"--how unnecessary----"

"Not to me."

"Well,--how cruel----"

"We've covered that. Cruelty doesn't exist where self-preservation is involved. You've been soldiers; you know that. Try another."

"Well, then, how stupid." "There," admitted Washington, "I grant you that. But try to think of an alternative. I've offered to have all or any of you painlessly executed if you wish. I've offered to have your wives, sweethearts, children, and mothers kidnapped and brought out here. I'll enlarge your place down there and feed and clothe you the rest of your lives. If there was some method of producing permanent amnesia I'd have all of you operated on and released immediately, somewhere outside of my preserves. But that's as far as my ideas go."

"How about trusting us not to peach on you?" cried some one.

"You don't proffer that suggestion seriously," said Washington, with an expression of scorn. "I did take out one man to teach my daughter Italian. Last week he got away."

A wild yell of jubilation went up suddenly from two dozen throats and a pandemonium of joy ensued. The prisoners clog-danced and cheered and yodled and wrestled with one another in a sudden uprush of animal spirits. They even ran up the glass sides of the bowl as far as they could, and slid back to the bottom upon the natural cushions of their bodies. The tall man started a song in which they all joined--

"oh, we'll hang the kaiser
on a sour apple tree----"
Braddock Washington sat in inscrutable silence until the song was over. "You see," he remarked, when he could gain a modicum of attention. "I bear you no ill-will. I like to see you enjoying yourselves. That's why I didn't tell you the whole story at once. The man--what was his name? Critchtichiello? --was shot by some of my agents in fourteen different places."
Not guessing that the places referred to were cities, the tumult of rejoicing subsided immediately.

"Nevertheless," cried Washington with a touch of anger, "he tried to run away. Do you expect me to take chances with any of you after an experience like that?"

Again a series of ejaculations went up.

"Sure!"

"Would your daughter like to learn Chinese?"

"Hey, I can speak Italian! My mother was a wop."

"Maybe she'd like t'learna speak N'Yawk!"

"If she's the little one with the big blue eyes I can teach her a lot of things better than Italian."

"I know some Irish songs--and I could hammer brass once't.

Mr. Washington reached forward suddenly with his cane and pushed the button in the grass so that the picture below went out instantly, and there remained only that great dark mouth covered dismally with the black teeth of the grating.

"Hey!" called a single voice from below, "you ain't goin' away without givin' us your blessing?"

But Mr. Washington, followed by the two boys, was already strolling on toward the ninth hole of the golf course, as though the pit and its contents were no more than a hazard over which his facile iron had triumphed with ease.

VII

JULY UNDER the lee of the diamond mountain was a month of blanket nights and of warm, glowing days. John and Kismine were in love. He did not know that the little gold football (inscribed with the legend Pro deo et patria et St. Midas) which he had given her rested on a platinum chain next to her bosom. But it did. And she for her part was not aware that a large sapphire which had dropped one day from her simple coiffure was stowed away tenderly in John's jewel box.
Late one afternoon when the ruby and ermine music room was quiet, they spent an hour there together. He held her hand and she gave him such a look that he whispered her name aloud. She bent toward him--then hesitated.

"Did you say 'Kismine'?" she asked softly, "or----"

She had wanted to be sure. She thought she might have misunderstood.

Neither of them had ever kissed before, but in the course of an hour it seemed to make little difference.

The afternoon drifted away. That night when a last breath of music drifted down from the highest tower, they each lay awake, happily dreaming over the separate minutes of the day. They had decided to be married as soon as possible.

VIII

EVERY DAY Mr. Washington and the two young men went hunting or fishing in the deep forests or played golf around the somnolent course--games which John diplomatically allowed his host to win--or swam in the mountain coolness of the lake. John found Mr. Washington a somewhat exacting personality--utterly uninterested in any ideas or opinions except his own. Mrs. Washington was aloof and reserved at all times. She was apparently indifferent to her two daughters, and entirely absorbed in her son Percy, with whom she held interminable conversations in rapid Spanish at dinner.
Jasmine, the elder daughter, resembled Kismine in appearance--except that she was somewhat bow-legged, and terminated in large hands and feet--but was utterly unlike her in temperament. Her favorite books had to do with poor girls who kept house for widowed fathers. John learned from Kismine that Jasmine had never recovered from the shock and disappointment caused her by the termination of the World War, just as she was about to start for Europe as a canteen expert. She had even pined away for a time, and Braddock Washington had taken steps to promote a new war in the Balkans--but she had seen a photograph of some wounded Serbian soldiers and lost interest in the whole proceedings. But Percy and Kismine seemed to have inherited the arrogant attitude in all its harsh magnificence from their father. A chaste and consistent selfishness ran like a pattern through their every idea.

John was enchanted by the wonders of the ch_teau and the valley. Braddock Washington, so Percy told him, had caused to be kidnapped a landscape gardener, an architect, a designer of state settings, and a French decadent poet left over from the last century. He had put his entire force of negroes at their disposal, guaranteed to supply them with any materials that the world could offer, and left them to work out some ideas of their own. But one by one they had shown their uselessness. The decadent poet had at once begun bewailing his separation from the boulevards in spring--he made some vague remarks about spices, apes, and ivories, but said nothing that was of any practical value. The stage designer on his part wanted to make the whole valley a series of tricks and sensational effects--a state of things that the Washingtons would soon have grown tired of. And as for the architect and the landscape gardener, they thought only in terms of convention. They must make this like this and that like that.

But they had, at least, solved the problem of what was to be done with them--they all went mad early one morning after spending the night in a single room trying to agree upon the location of a fountain, and were now confined comfortably in an insane asylum at Westport, Connecticut.

"But," inquired John curiously, "who did plan all your wonderful reception rooms and halls, and approaches and bathrooms----?"

"Well," answered Percy, "I blush to tell you, but it was a moving-picture fella. He was the only man we found who was used to playing with an unlimited amount of money, though he did tuck his napkin in his collar and couldn't read or write."

As August drew to a close John began to regret that he must soon go back to school. He and Kismine had decided to elope the following June.

"It would be nicer to be married here," Kismine confessed, "but of course I could never get father's permission to marry you at all. Next to that I'd rather elope. It's terrible for wealthy people to be married in America at present--they always have to send out bulletins to the press saying that they're going to be married in remnants, when what they mean is just a peck of old second-hand pearls and some used lace worn once by the Empress Eug_nie."

"I know," agreed John fervently. "When I was visiting the Schnlitzer-Murphys, the eldest daughter, Gwendolyn, married a man whose father owns half of West Virginia. She wrote home saying what a tough struggle she was carrying on on his salary as a bank clerk--and then she ended up by saying that 'Thank God, I have four good maids anyhow, and that helps a little.'"

"It's absurd," commented Kismine. "Think of the millions and millions of people in the world, laborers and all, who get along with only two maids."

One afternoon late in August a chance remark of Kismine's changed the face of the entire situation, and threw John into a state of terror.

They were in their favorite grove, and between kisses John was indulging in some romantic forebodings which he fancied added poignancy to their relations.

"Sometimes I think we'll never marry," he said sadly.

"You're too wealthy, too magnificent. No one as rich as you are can be like other girls. I should marry the daughter of some well-to-do wholesale hardware man from Omaha or Sioux City, and be content with her half-million."

"I knew the daughter of a wholesale hardware man once," remarked Kismine. "I don't think you'd have been contented with her. She was a friend of my sister's. She visited here."

"Oh, then you've had other guests?" exclaimed John in surprise.

Kismine seemed to regret her words.

"Oh, yes," she said hurriedly, "we've had a few."

"But aren't you--wasn't your father afraid they'd talk outside?"

"Oh, to some extent, to some extent," she answered. "Let's talk about something pleasanter."

But John's curiosity was aroused.

"Something pleasanter!" he demanded. "What's unpleasant about that? Weren't they nice girls?"

To his great surprise Kismine began to weep.

"Yes--th--that's the--the whole t-trouble. I grew qu-quite attached to some of them. So did Jasmine, but she kept inv-viting them anyway. I couldn't understand it."

A dark suspicion was born in John's heart.

"Do you mean that they told, and your father had them--removed?"

"Worse than that," she muttered brokenly. "Father took no chances--and Jasmine kept writing them to come, and they had such a good time!"

She was overcome by a paroxysm of grief.

Stunned with the horror of this revelation, John sat there open-mouthed, feeling the nerves of his body twitter like so many sparrows perched upon his spinal column.

"Now, I've told you, and I shouldn't have," she said, calming suddenly and drying her dark blue eyes.

"Do you mean to say that your father had them murdered before they left?"

She nodded.

"In August usually--or early in September. It's only natural for us to get all the pleasure out of them that we can first."

"How abdominable! How--why, I must be going crazy! Did you really admit that--"

"I did," interrupted Kismine, shrugging her shoulders. "We can't very well imprison them like those aviators, where they'd be a continual reproach to us every day. And it's always been made easier for Jasmine and me because father had it done sooner than we expected. In that way we avoided any farewell scene----"

"So you murdered them! Uh!" cried John.

"It was done very nicely. They were drugged while they were asleep--and their families were always told that they died of scarlet fever in Butte."

"But--I fail to understand why you kept on inviting them!"

"I didn't," burst out Kismine. "I never invited one. Jasmine did. And they always had a very good time. She'd give them the nicest presents toward the last. I shall probably have visitors too--I'll harden up to it. We can't let such an inevitable thing as death stand in the way of enjoying life while we have it. Think how lonesome it'd be out here if we never had any one. Why, father and mother have sacrificed some of their best friends just as we have."

"And so," cried John accusingly, "and so you were letting me make love to you and pretending to return it, and talking about marriage, all the time knowing perfectly well that I'd never get out of here alive--"

"No," she protested passionately. "Not any more. I did at first. You were here. I couldn't help that, and I thought your last days might as well be pleasant for both of us. But then I fell in love with you, and--and I'm honestly sorry you're going to--going to be put away--though I'd rather you'd be put away than ever kiss another girl."

"Oh, you would, would you?" cried John ferociously.

"Much rather. Besides, I've always heard that a girl can have more fun with a man whom she knows she can never marry. Oh, why did I tell you? I've probably spoiled your whole good time now, and we were really enjoying things when you didn't know it. I knew it would make things sort of depressing for you."

"Oh, you did, did you?" John's voice trembled with anger. "I've heard about enough of this. If you haven't any more pride and decency than to have an affair with a fellow that you know isn't much better than a corpse, I don't want to have any more to do with you!"

"You're not a corpse!" she protested in horror. "You're not a corpse! I won't have you saying that I kissed a corpse!"

"I said nothing of the sort!"

"You did! You said I kissed a corpse!"

"I didn't ! "

Their voices had risen, but upon a sudden interruption they both subsided into immediate silence. Footsteps were coming along the path in their direction, and a moment later the rose bushes were parted displaying Braddock Washington, whose intelligent eyes set in his good-looking vacuous face were peering in at them.

"Who kissed a corpse?" he demanded in obvious disapproval.

"Nobody," answered Kismine quickly. "We were just joking."

"What are you two doing here, anyhow?" he demanded gruffly. "Kismine, you ought to be--to be reading or playing golf with your sister. Go read! Go play golf! Don't let me find you here when I come back!"

Then he bowed at John and went up the path.

"See?" said Kismine crossly, when he was out of hearing. "You've spoiled it all. We can never meet any more. He won't let me meet you. He'd have you poisoned if he thought we were in love."

"We're not, any more!" cried John fiercely, "so he can set his mind at rest upon that. Moreover, don't fool yourself that I'm going to stay around here. Inside of six hours I'll be over those mountains, if I have to gnaw a passage through them, and on my way East."

They had both got to their feet, and at this remark Kismine came close and put her arm through his.

"I'm going, too."

"You must be crazy----"

"Of course I'm going," she interrupted impatiently.

"You most certainly are not. You----"

"Very well," she said quietly, "we'll catch up with father now and talk it over with him."

Defeated, John mustered a sickly smile.

"Very well, dearest," he agreed, with pale and unconvincing affection, "we'll go together."

His love for her returned and settled placidly on his heart. She was his--she would go with him to share his dangers. He put his arms about her and kissed her fervently. After all she loved him; she had saved him, in fact.

Discussing the matter, they walked slowly back toward the ch_teau. They decided that since Braddock Washington had seen them together they had best depart the next night. Nevertheless, John's lips were unusually dry at dinner, and he nervously emptied a great spoonful of peacock soup into his left lung. He had to be carried into the turquoise and sable card-room and pounded on the back by one of the under-butlers, which Percy considered a great joke.

IX

LONG AFTER midnight John's body gave a nervous jerk, and he sat suddenly upright, staring into the veils of somnolence that draped the room. Through the squares of blue darkness that were his open windows, he had heard a faint far-away sound that died upon a bed of wind before identifying itself on his memory, clouded with uneasy dreams. But the sharp noise that had succeeded it was nearer, was just outside the room--the click of a turned knob, a footstep, a whisper, he could not tell; a hard lump gathered in the pit of his stomach, and his whole body ached in the moment that he strained agonizingly to hear. Then one of the veils seemed to dissolve, and he saw a vague figure standing by the door, a figure only faintly limned and blocked in upon the darkness, mingled so with the folds of the drapery as to seem distorted, like a reflection seen in a dirty pane of glass.
With a sudden movement of fright or resolution John pressed the button by his bedside, and the next moment he was sitting in the green sunken bath of the adjoining room, waked into alertness by the shock of the cold water which half filled it.

He sprang out, and, his wet pajamas scattering a heavy trickle of water behind him, ran for the aquamarine door which he knew led out onto the ivory landing of the second floor. The door opened noiselessly. A single crimson lamp burning in a great dome above lit the magnificent sweep of the carved stairways with a poignant beauty. For a moment John hesitated, appalled by the silent splendor massed about him, seeming to envelop in its gigantic folds and contours the solitary drenched little figure shivering upon the ivory landing. Then simultaneously two things happened. The door of his own sitting-room swung open, precipitating three naked negroes into the hall--and, as John swayed in wild terror toward the stairway, another door slid back in the wall on the other side of the corridor, and John saw Braddock Washington standing in the lighted lift, wearing a fur coat and a pair of riding boots which reached to his knees and displayed, above, the glow of his rose-colored pajamas.

On the instant the three negroes--John had never seen any of them before, and it flashed through his mind that they must be the professional executioners--paused in their movement toward John, and turned expectantly to the man in the lift, who burst out with an imperious command:

"Get in here! All three of you! Quick as hell!"

Then, within the instant, the three negroes darted into the cage, the oblong of light was blotted out as the lift door slid shut, and John was again alone in the hall. He slumped weakly down against an ivory stair.

It was apparent that something portentous had occurred, something which, for the moment at least, had postponed his own petty disaster. What was it? Had the negroes risen in revolt? Had the aviators forced aside the iron bars of the grating? Or had the men of Fish stumbled blindly through the hills and gazed with bleak, joyless eyes upon the gaudy valley? John did not know. He heard a faint whir of air as the lift whizzed up again, and then, a moment later, as it descended. It was probable that Percy was hurrying to his father's assistance, and it occurred to John that this was his opportunity to join Kismine and plan an immediate escape. He waited until the lift had been silent for several minutes; shivering a little with the night cool that whipped in through his wet pajamas, he returned to his room and dressed himself quickly. Then he mounted a long flight of stairs and turned down the corridor carpeted with Russian sable which led to Kismine's suite.

The door of her sitting-room was open and the lamps were lighted. Kismine, in an angora kimono, stood near the window of the room in a listening attitude, and as John entered noiselessly she turned toward him.

"Oh, it's you!" she whispered, crossing the room to him. "Did you hear them?"

"I heard your father's slaves in my----"

"No," she interrupted excitedly. "Aeroplanes!"

"Aeroplanes? Perhaps that was the sound that woke me."

"There're at least a dozen. I saw one a few moments ago dead against the moon. The guard back by the cliff fired his rifle and that's what roused father. We're going to open on them right away."

"Are they here on purpose?"

"Yes--it's that Italian who got away----"

Simultaneously with her last word, a succession of sharp cracks tumbled in through the open window. Kismine uttered a little cry, took a penny with fumbling fingers from a box on her dresser, and ran to one of the electric lights. In an instant the entire ch_teau was in darkness--she had blown out the fuse.

"Come on!" she cried to him. "We'll go up to the roof garden, and watch it from there!"

Drawing a cape about her, she took his hand, and they found their way out the door. It was only a step to the tower lift, and as she pressed the button that shot them upward he put his arms around her in the darkness and kissed her mouth. Romance had come to John Unger at last. A minute later they had stepped out upon the star-white platform. Above, under the misty moon, sliding in and out of the patches of cloud that eddied below it, floated a dozen dark-winged bodies in a constant circling course. From here and there in the valley flashes of fire leaped toward them, followed by sharp detonations. Kismine clapped her hands with pleasure, which, a moment later, turned to dismay as the aeroplanes at some prearranged signal, began to release their bombs and the whole of the valley became a panorama of deep reverberate sound and lurid light.

Before long the aim of the attackers became concentrated upon the points where the anti-aircraft guns were situated, and one of them was almost immediately reduced to a giant cinder to lie smouldering in a park of rose bushes.

"Kismine," begged John, "you'll be glad when I tell you that this attack came on the eve of my murder. If I hadn't heard that guard shoot off his gun back by the pass I should now be stone dead----"

"I can't hear you!" cried Kismine, intent on the scene before her. "You'll have to talk louder!"

"I simply said, " shouted John, "that we'd better get out before they begin to shell the ch_teau!"

Suddenly the whole portico of the negro quarters cracked asunder, a geyser of flame shot up from under the colonnades, and great fragments of jagged marble were hurled as far as the borders of the lake.

"There go fifty thousand dollars' worth of slaves," cried Kismine, "at prewar prices. So few Americans have any respect for property."

John renewed his efforts to compel her to leave. The aim of the aeroplanes was becoming more precise minute by minute, and only two of the antiaircraft guns were still retaliating. It was obvious that the garrison, encircled with fire, could not hold out much longer.

"Come on!" cried John, pulling Kismine's arm, "we've got to go. Do you realize that those aviators will kill you without question if they find you ?"

She consented reluctantly.

"We'll have to wake Jasmine!" she said, as they hurried toward the lift. Then she added in a sort of childish delight: "We'll be poor, won't we? Like people in books. And I'll be an orphan and utterly free. Free and poor! What fun!" She stopped and raised her lips to him in a delighted kiss.

"It's impossible to be both together," said John grimly. "People have found that out. And I should choose to be free as preferable of the two. As an extra caution you'd better dump the contents of your jewel box into your pockets."

Ten minutes later the two girls met John in the dark corridor and they descended to the main floor of the ch_teau. Passing for the last time through the magnificence of the splendid halls, they stood for a moment out on the terrace, watching the burning negro quarters and the flaming embers of two planes which had fallen on the other side of the lake. A solitary gun was still keeping up a sturdy popping, and the attackers seemed timorous about descending lower, but sent their thunderous fireworks in a circle around it, until any chance shot might annihilate its Ethiopian crew.

John and the two sisters passed down the marble steps, turned sharply to the left, and began to ascend a narrow path that wound like a garter about the diamond mountain. Kismine knew a heavily wooded spot half-way up where they could lie concealed and yet be able to observe the wild night in the valley--finally to make an escape, when it should be necessary, along a secret path laid in a rocky gully.

X

IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK when they attained their destination. The obliging and phlegmatic Jasmine fell off to sleep immediately, leaning against the trunk of a large tree, while John and Kismine sat, his arm around her, and watched the desperate ebb and flow of the dying battle among the ruins of a vista that had been a garden spot that morning. Shortly after four o'clock the last remaining gun gave out a clanging sound and went out of action in a swift tongue of red smoke. Though the moon was down, they saw that the flying bodies were circling closer to the earth. When the planes had made certain that the beleaguered possessed no further resources, they would land and the dark and glittering reign of the Washingtons would be over.
With the cessation of the firing the valley grew quiet. The embers of the two aeroplanes glowed like the eyes of some monster crouching in the grass. The ch_teau stood dark and silent, beautiful without light as it had been beautiful in the sun, while the woody rattles of Nemesis filled the air above with a growing and receding complaint. Then John perceived that Kismine, like her sister, had fallen sound asleep.

It was long after four when he became aware of footsteps along the path they had lately followed, and he waited in breathless silence until the persons to whom they belonged had passed the vantage-point he occupied. There was a faint stir in the air now that was not of human origin, and the dew was cold; he knew that the dawn would break soon. John waited until the steps had gone a safe distance up the mountain and were inaudible. Then he followed. About half-way to the steep summit the trees fell away and a hard saddle of rock spread itself over the diamond beneath. Just before he reached this point he slowed down his pace, warned by an animal sense that there was life just ahead of him. Coming to a high boulder, he lifted his head gradually above its edge. His curiosity was rewarded; this is what he saw:

Braddock Washington was standing there motionless, silhouetted against the gray sky without sound or sign of life. As the dawn came up out of the east, lending a cold green color to the earth, it brought the solitary figure into insignificant contrast with the new day.

While John watched, his host remained for a few moments absorbed in some inscrutable contemplation; then he signalled to the two negroes who crouched at his feet to lift the burden which lay between them. As they struggled upright, the first yellow beam of the sun struck through the innumerable prisms of an immense and exquisitely chiselled diamond--and a white radiance was kindled that glowed upon the air like a fragment of the morning star. The bearers staggered beneath its weight for a moment--then their rippling muscles caught and hardened under the wet shine of the skins and the three figures were again motionless in their defiant impotency before the heavens.

After a while the white man lifted his head and slowly raised his arms in a gesture of attention, as one who would call a great crowd to hear--but there was no crowd, only the vast silence of the mountain and the sky, broken by faint bird voices down among the trees. The figure on the saddle of rock began to speak ponderously and with an inextinguishable pride.

"You out there--" he cried in a trembling voice. "You-- there--!" He paused, his arms still uplifted, his head held attentively as though he were expecting an answer. John strained his eyes to see whether there might be men coming down the mountain, but the mountain was bare of human life. There was only sky and a mocking flute of wind along the tree-tops. Could Washington be praying? For a moment John wondered. Then the illusion passed--there was something in the man's whole attitude antithetical to prayer.

"Oh, you above there!"

The voice was become strong and confident. This was no forlorn supplication. If anything, there was in it a quality of monstrous condescension.

"You there----"

Words, too quickly uttered to be understood, flowing one into the other. . . . John listened breathlessly, catching a phrase here and there, while the voice broke off, resumed, broke off again--now strong and argumentative, now colored with a slow, puzzled impatience. Then a conviction commenced to dawn on the single listener, and as realization crept over him a spray of quick blood rushed through his arteries. Braddock Washington was offering a bribe to God!

That was it--there was no doubt. The diamond in the arms of his slaves was some advance sample, a promise of more to follow.

That, John perceived after a time, was the thread running through his sentences. Prometheus Enriched was calling to witness forgotten sacrifices, forgotten rituals, prayers obsolete before the birth of Christ. For a while his discourse took the form of reminding God of this gift or that which Divinity had deigned to accept from men--great churches if he would rescue cities from the plague, gifts of myrrh and gold, of human lives and beautiful women and captive armies, of children and queens, of beasts of the forest and field, sheep and goats, harvests and cities, whole conquered lands that had been offered up in lust or blood for His appeasal, buying a meed's worth of alleviation from the Divine wrath--and now he, Braddock Washington, Emperor of Diamonds, king and priest of the age of gold, arbiter of splendor and luxury, would offer up a treasure such as princes before him had never dreamed of, offer it up not in suppliance, but in pride.

He would give to God, he continued, getting down to specifications, the greatest diamond in the world. This diamond would be cut with many more thousand facets than there were leaves on a tree, and yet the whole diamond would be shaped with the perfection of a stone no bigger than a fly. Many men would work upon it for many years. It would be set in a great dome of beaten gold, wonderfully carved and equipped with gates of opal and crusted sapphire. In the middle would be hollowed out a chapel presided over by an altar of iridescent, decomposing, ever-changing radium which would burn out the eyes of any worshipper who lifted up his head from prayer--and on this altar there would be slain for the amusement of the Divine Benefactor any victim He should choose, even though it should be the greatest and most powerful man alive.

In return he asked only a simple thing, a thing that for God would be absurdly easy--only that matters should be as they were yesterday at this hour and that they should so remain. So very simple! Let but the heavens open, swallowing these men and their aeroplanes--and then close again. Let him have his slaves once more, restored to life and well.

There was no one else with whom he had ever needed to treat or bargain.

He doubted only whether he had made his bribe big enough. God had His price, of course. God was made in man's image, so it had been said: He must have His price. And the price would be rare--no cathedral whose building consumed many years, no pyramid constructed by ten thousand workmen, would be like this cathedral, this pyramid.

He paused here. That was his proposition. Everything would be up to specifications and there was nothing vulgar in his assertion that it would be cheap at the price. He implied that Providence could take it or leave it.

As he approached the end his sentences became broken, became short and uncertain, and his body seemed tense, seemed strained to catch the slightest pressure or whisper of life in the spaces around him. His hair had turned gradually white as he talked, and now he lifted his head high to the heavens like a prophet of old--magnificently mad.

Then, as John stared in giddy fascination, it seemed to him that a curious phenomenon took place somewhere around him. It was as though the sky had darkened for an instant, as though there had been a sudden murmur in a gust of wind, a sound of far-away trumpets, a sighing like the rustle of a great silken robe--for a time the whole of nature round about partook of this darkness; the birds' song ceased; the trees were still, and far over the mountain there was a mutter of dull, menacing thunder.

That was all. The wind died along the tall grasses of the valley. The dawn and the day resumed their place in a time, and the risen sun sent hot waves of yellow mist that made its path bright before it. The leaves laughed in the sun, and their laughter shook the trees until each bough was like a girl's school in fairyland. God had refused to accept the bribe.

For another moment John watched the triumph of the day. Then, turning he saw a flutter of brown down by the lake, then another flutter, then another, like the dance of golden angels alighting from the clouds. The aeroplanes had come to earth.

John slid off the boulder and ran down the side of the mountain to the clump of trees, where the two girls were awake and waiting for him. Kismine sprang to her feet, the jewels in her pockets jingling, a question on her parted lips, but instinct told John that there was no time for words. They must get off the mountain without losing a moment. He seized a hand of each and in silence they threaded the tree-trunks, washed with light now and with the rising mist. Behind them from the valley came no sound at all, except the complaint of the peacocks far away and the pleasant undertone of morning.

When they had gone about half a mile, they avoided the park land and entered a narrow path that led over the next rise of ground. At the highest point of this they paused and turned around. Their eyes rested upon the mountainside they had just left--oppressed by some dark sense of tragic impendency.

Clear against the sky a broken, white-haired man was slowly descending the steep slope, followed by two gigantic and emotionless negroes, who carried a burden between them which still flashed and glittered in the sun. Half-way down two other figures joined them--John could see that they were Mrs. Washington and her son, upon whose arm she leaned. The aviators had clambered from their machines to the sweeping lawn in front of the ch_teau, and with rifles in hand were starting up the diamond mountain in skirmishing formation.

But the little group of five which had formed farther up and was engrossing all the watchers' attention had stopped upon a ledge of rock. The negroes stooped and pulled up what appeared to be a trap-door in the side of the mountain. Into this they all disappeared, the white-haired man first, then his wife and son, finally the two negroes, the glittering tips of whose jeweled head-dresses caught the sun for a moment before the trap-door descended and engulfed them all.

Kismine clutched John's arm.

"Oh," she cried wildly, "where are they going? What are they going to do?"

"It must be some underground way of escape "

A little scream from the two girls interrupted his sentence.

"Don't you see?" sobbed Kismine hysterically. "The mountain is wired!"

Even as she spoke John put up his hands to shield his sight. Before their eyes the whole surface of the mountain had changed suddenly to a dazzling burning yellow, which showed up through the jacket of turf as light shows through a human hand. For a moment the intolerable glow continued, and then like an extinguished filament it disappeared, revealing a black waste from which blue smoke arose slowly, carrying off with it what remained of vegetation and of human flesh. Of the aviators there was left neither blood, nor bone--they were consumed as completely as the five souls who had gone inside.

Simultaneously, and with an immense concussion, the ch_teau literally threw itself into the air, bursting into flaming fragments as it rose, and then tumbling back upon itself in a smoking pile that lay projecting half into the water of the lake. There was no fire--what smoke there was drifted off mingling with the sunshine, and for a few minutes longer a powdery dust of marble drifted from the great featureless pile that had once been the house of jewels. There was no more sound and the three people were alone in the valley.

XI

AT SUNSET John and his two companions reached the high cliff which had marked the boundaries of the Washingtons' dominion, and looking back found the valley tranquil and lovely in the dusk. They sat down to finish the food which Jasmine had brought with her in a basket.
"There!" she said, as she spread the table-cloth and put the sandwiches in a neat pile upon it. "Don't they look tempting? I always think that food tastes better outdoors."

"With that remark," remarked Kismine, "Jasmine enters the middle class."

"Now," said John eagerly, "turn out your pocket and let's see what jewels you brought along. If you made a good selection we three ought to live comfortably all the rest of our lives."

Obediently Kismine put her hand in her pocket and tossed two handfuls of glittering stones before him.

"Not so bad," cried John, enthusiastically. "They aren't very big, but-- Hello!" His expression changed as he held one of them up to the declining sun. "Why, these aren't diamonds! There's something the matter!"

"By golly!" exclaimed Kismine, with a startled look. "What an idiot I am!"

"Why, these are rhinestones!" cried John.

"I know." She broke into a laugh. "I opened the wrong drawer. They belonged on the dress of a girl who visited Jasmine. I got her to give them to me in exchange for diamonds. I'd never seen anything but precious stones before."

"And this is what you brought?"

"I'm afraid so." She fingered the brilliants wistfully. "I think I like these better. I'm a little tired of diamonds."

"Very well," said John gloomily. "We'll have to live in Hades. And you will grow old telling incredulous women that you got the wrong drawer. Unfortunately your father's bank-books were consumed with him."

"Well, what's the matter with Hades?"

"If I come home with a wife at my age my father is just as liable as not to cut me off with a hot coal, as they say down there."

Jasmine spoke up.

"I love washing," she said quietly. "I have always washed my own handkerchiefs. I'll take in laundry and support you both."

"Do they have washwomen in Hades?" asked Kismine innocently.

"Of course," answered John. "It's just like anywhere else."

"I thought--perhaps it was too hot to wear any clothes."

John laughed.

"Just try it!" he suggested. "They'll run you out before you're half started."

"Will father be there?" she asked.

John turned to her in astonishment.

"Your father is dead," he replied somberly. "Why should he go to Hades? You have it confused with another place that was abolished long ago."

After supper they folded up the table-cloth and spread their blankets for the night.

"What a dream it was," Kismine sighed, gazing up at the stars. "How strange it seems to be here with one dress and a penniless fianc_!

"Under the stars," she repeated. "I never noticed the stars before. I always thought of them as great big diamonds that belonged to some one. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream, all my youth."

"It was a dream," said John quietly. "Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness."

"How pleasant then to be insane!"

"So I'm told," said John gloomily. "I don't know any longer. At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That's a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it." He shivered. "Turn up your coat collar, little girl, the night's full of chill and you'll get pneumonia. His was a great sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours."

So wrapping himself in his blanket he fell off to sleep.13EmbedLe crime parfait (English Translation) Lyrics[Lyrics to "The Perfect Crime"]

The problem is that it's those who get screwed who give them advice
It's not a life, that's worse than the Play', to scare them a little, I have cartridges of sixteen
I don't choose, I take one of each (Mad, mad, mad, mad)
Headache, shut the fuck up and fill the bag (bag, bag, bag, bag,)
Fuck the state, I dont give a fuck, we stack (Gang), I need a lot of plates (Oh, oh, mad, mad, mad, mad)
H-H-H24 it's about Ziak, I have brand new friends who is looking for black

I go to 'dam, kiss in Belgium, I pass the customs
With a girl, a baby seat, unsuspected mothers, small bags of CC, she snitch and goes to the table
Basically, it's normal, she's dead hungry, you paid her badly
I-I have ten kilos, I have ten cellphone, I'm not very far from the perfect crime

[Chorus]
State of emergency, it's a lethal weapon
A beautiful car riddled with bullets (Oh)

Rosé's vocals on the songs of BLACKPINK generally packs a punch and have a certain attitude to it. But, ever since hearing her part on the bridge of "Lovesick Girls", I was craving for the soulful and emotional side of it. And "Gone" delivered exactly that. When I first heard the teaser of the song, I was immediately in love with the melancholic and slow guitar strums, and the chorus was also already latched onto my mind. And when she performed the song on THE SHOW, it immеdiately solidified its position on my top favorite songs of all timе. Every time I hear the song, a breeze of nostalgia sweeps over me. And despite the lyrics talking about hardships and pain, it gives me warm waves of comfort.

- Nosyneko"Drunk-Dazed" - ENHYPENOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Admittedly, I am not the biggest fan of ENHYPEN; when Drunk-Dazed came out, I had already put the group off to the side, despite having watched the entirety of i-land. However, "Drunk-Dazed's" horror carnival concept really helped me hit the nail on defining what kind of a group ENHYPEN is; before, as a casual listener, I often felt as if ENHYPEN and other boy groups sometimes overlapped in sound and concept. "Drunk-Dazed" flowed very naturally and never lost the momentum gained by the bass starting in the first verse, despite the melodic verses, chorus, and bridge all sounding distinctively different. The chorus is simply phenomenal: the repetition of the lyrics conforms to the song's concept and makes you feel like you're stuck on a carnival ride, and the high pitched variations in the lyrics convey a wonderful anomaly to conformity, but never jarring nor frightening. The dynamic, yet sharp choreography of "Drunk-Dazed" takes the song one step further to showcase the ability of HYBE and ENHYPEN to seamlessly weave together the music and the arts.

- ANC613"Lose" - WONHOOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
It must have not been easy to make a comeback after releasing a debut song as good and powerful as “Open Mind,” but WONHO made it look so easy with the EDM pop-dance track “Lose.” Its catchy lyrics that play over the fast-paced instrumental and the easy-flowing voice of WONHO quickens the process of getting this song stuck in your head, as well as the cold-colored visuals in the music video that help magnify the creativeness of the choreography. Through this release that serves as an enjoyable ride, WONHO stays true to the classic-pop staple sound he’s proven to have mastered over his past releases, as he also promises to offer quality and dedication to his work.
- loveholic"0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You)" - TXT ft. SeoriOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
After the success of minisode1, came a new chapter for the group being FREEZE. Of course, being TXT, they experiment with each comeback and this one makes you go "Like oh my god, so holy". The lead song, "0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You)" is an emo rock style song with an anthemic and powerful instrumental. The amazing chorus and beat will definitely be one where you scream out the lyrics at the beginning of dusk, in the car (carefully, of course, safety is first), or vibing to it at 3 am to get in the feels. Just makes you wanna go like this. But don't be fooled by the melody, because the lyrics are truly on to break your heart. Being written and composed by Danke (lalala studio), “hitman” Bang, Melanie Joy Fontana, MOD SUN, RM & Slow Rabbit (just to name a few), it is surely one of the group's best songs yet! The lyrics are emotional and romantic centering on a person struggling for love. The strong concept and emotional lyrics are amplified by the hidden details in the music video. When it came out, you bet I was sobbing by the visuals of the music video and the lyrics. It made me fall in love with TXT all over again! Now then, better get back to something......."ˢᵃʸ ʸᵒᵘ ˡᵒᵛᵉ ᵐᵉ, ˢᵃʸ ʸᵒᵘ ˡᵒᵛᵉ ᵐᵉ...."

- Hobschiske"Alcohol-Free" - TWICEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Ever since "Fancy", TWICE keeps surprising us comeback after comeback by trying different sounds. After offering their own take on tropical house with "More & More", exploring a more retro, Dua Lipa-esque vibe on "I Can't Stop Me", and finally showing a darker side with "Cry for Me", they are now back with a summer song that feels really unique, "Alcohol-Free". The unexpected association of bossa nova with hip-hop (!) works amazingly well and creates a refreshing atmosphere that I haven't experienced in other K-pop songs. The members' vocals particularly shine, with smooth vocalizations at the end of each sentence. Listening to the track takes me away from my daily life for a while and I find myself chilling on a sunbed with a cocktail in hand – whether a mojito, margarita or alcohol-free – exactly what a good summer song is supposed to make you feel like, right?

- ab212"Beautiful Beautiful" - ONFOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
"Beautiful Beautiful" is straight-up 2016-2018 K-pop nostalgia, a.k.a my three favorite years of K-pop. This vocally driven track was the throwback I had been looking for for a long while. The refreshing vibe of the song and its colorful music video me feels like the intro to a video game, and reminds me of songs like "DNA," "Really Really," "Fancy" and "Anpanman." Personally, the best parts of this song are the Intro and the Bridge, the two most vocally driven parts of the song; the bridge especially had my attention for the incorporation of some good old beatboxing. It's a
reminder to me that good vocal technique and colorful songs like "Beautiful Beautiful" still have a persisting footing in K-pop. From the dramatic piano in "사랑하게 될 거야 (We Must Love)" to the playful vocals of "Beautiful Beautiful," ONF definitely has my attention.

- ANC613"Troll" - IU ft. DEANOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Marking my favorite dynamic duo’s highly anticipated collaboration, “Troll” sees IU and DEAN tell the familiar tale of two lovestruck exes who are not quite over each other. Sprinkled with sweet melodies, the song begins with IU’s light, euphonious vocals that detail her honest confessions. Lyrics that instantly stand out to me are present in verse 1, which translate to: “You can come without letting me know / You can mess up my day.” Personally, these lines elucidate just how hopelessly in love IU is; perhaps they are a little nostalgic for some. Effortlessly, verse 2 showcases DEAN’s soothing vocals which highlight his nonchalant perspective on the relationship. Honestly, the song feels like it’s somewhat of a prequel to April 2017’s “Can’t Love You Anymore,” as if it were explaining the backstory to how such intense feelings of love slowly burnt out. Overall, the song evokes foregone memories of my youth and is reminiscent of the cool, refreshing breeze felt on those long summer nights. Hopefully, this won’t be their only collaboration as the pair complement each other wonderfully!

- zealotofstockholm"BLUE" - TaeyongOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
As Taeyong began to release his self-written songs in March of this year, we’ve been gifted with a repertoire that varies in genres and show Taeyong’s pure artistry. In “BLUE,” Taeyong proved yet again how efficient and versatile of an artist he is, as he took on the challenge of trying out a rock-inspired sound that progressively and successfully grew to become a disclosure of Taeyong’s fresh emotions. But the lyrics of the song are what spoke the loudest to me; seeing an artist I’ve always looked up to come forward and offer us a look into his deepest thoughts while sharing soothing words really made me understand the impact music can have on one’s life. Through the powerful lessons taught by Taeyong and his raw vocals filled with both sentiment and vehemence, I found comfort in finding out that even the people I admire can sometimes feel the same way I do, and I truly do wish that as we gain energy from his encouraging words and eloquent storytelling, he can also find comfort in sharing his feelings with his TyongFs.

- loveholic"After School" - WeeeklyOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
If you don't know of Weeekly, you should at least know of "After School," the bubblegum pop K-Pop song that has been covered by thousands around the world in the newest of viral dance challenges. This success is astonishing for the group, who was not even a year old when the song blew up. I admit I started listening to "After School" after it went viral, but the song is memorable in more ways than one. As expected from a song titled "After School," the lyrics are filled with student life anecdotes – running through corridors, riding skateboards, and hanging out with friends while recording every moment for long-lasting memories. Overall, the song is reminiscent of all the freedoms of being a teenager before moving onto the next stages of life. Though a bright song, all this mention of being free brings upon some nostalgia. High school is the peak moment of freedom in many lives, and many memories from high school last a lifetime. But what about high schoolers today? In March 2021 (when the song was released), most teenagers around the world were being taught online, trapped inside of their homes. Students are supposed to be experiencing the freest years of their lives, but being trapped inside their houses twenty-four hours a day is making them miss out on the whole experience. A bright song like "After School," also sung by some young adults/teenagers can help raise the spirits. Students should have hope for the end of the pandemic when they can be freer and live the real school experience.

- PlanNine16"First" - EVERGLOWOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
For girl groups with powerful concepts, EVERGLOW is a name that should come to mind. The sextet has explored many different genres, such as powerful military-style "Adios" and retro "La Di Da." With "FIRST," EVERGLOW continues to prove they are aiming for the top, while also being the "firsts" exploring varieties of power concepts. "FIRST" is a powerful trap-EDM track that makes me feel like I'm about to face off against the final boss in a video game (which may as well be EVERGLOW). The song is so much in EVERGLOW's style and it does a good take at showing off the girls' talents. Newly appointed leader Sihyeon got a big share of the vocal parts, allowing her to show off her vocals alongside Mia. Onda, lacking recognition throughout their career, got the center position for the dance break. Aisha and Yiren made the stage theirs with their amazing charisma. And last but not least, main rapper E:U, with only two (fire) bars in the whole song, added the last bit of spice needed to make "FIRST" one of the most powerful addicting songs of 2021 so far.

- PlanNine16"Butter" - BTSOriginal Song
I was very excited and looked forward to "Butter" as soon as BTS announced its release.  And as I thought, they didn't disappoint me. It was a great song and I can't stop listening to it ever since.  For me, the best part of the song is the chorus & verse 3 (especially SUGA's rap part), I also love the instrumental part after the second chorus. RM's songwriting made the song feel even more personal. I believe this song has better proved BTS' success and it showed how perfect BTS are. The music video is a visual treat and all the members looked amazing. With "Butter," BTS has once again given us fans a summer anthem to vibe all year long.

- aAOfficial"I Wish" - Jimmy Brown & Sweet The KidOriginal Song
A collaboration project group that we never knew was going to happen, Jimmy Brown, Rovv and Sweet The Kid. Making a project group called The Good Days Boys and the trio released their first collaboration album includes, "i wish" as one of the title songs. Knowing how distinct Jimmy Brown's and Sweet The Kid's styles are, made me wonder how their songs will sound like on this collaboration. Through this song, both artists show their different styles of sexy R&B with simple lyrics and repetitive lines of "I wish, I'm wishin'" as their addictive chorus enhancing the chemistry between them. This EP is the second collaboration project that Jimmy Brown has started in 2021, and the next volume was recently released on June 27th.

- sa44"Dun Dun Dance" - OH MY GIRLOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
After their major successes in 2020 with "Nonstop" and "Dolphin," OH MY GIRL confidently returned to the stage this spring with "Dun Dun Dance." The song follows the route that "Nonstop" paved for the group, incorporating a lot more pop-dance elements than their previous releases which were softer and vocal-heavy. "Dun Dun Dance" also includes some retro and nu-disco elements, which were popularised in K-Pop last year. This shift in genre not only got them more popularity and attention, but it allows the group to showcase a more well-rounded image. Since they are a vocally-heavy group, "Dun Dun Dance" has a number of vocal parts that show off the vocalists' talents well. In contrast, the group's one rapper Mimi is also given time to shine, with bouncy rap parts sprinkled throughout the song to create the ultimate jam. "Dun Dun Dance" really helped kick off my summer right – It's bright, fun, and of course, it makes you want to dance! So dun dun dance (Whatever that means)!

- PlanNine16"riBBon" - BamBamOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
"riBBon" simultaneously manages to be a safe beginning to GOT7 member BamBam's solo and a boomy track that has many unique elements. The production is very careful - very intentional. The majority of the time it's hi-hats with a rhythm heavily carried by the punchy bassline alone, but, during the refrain, the instrumental is briefly stripped down to simply snaps and angelic vocal layering. The pitch tuning in "here we go" is used to lead into the euphoric chorus (if you listen carefully, you'll notice a deeper edit is layered under). The outro is by far the most interesting and experimental part of the song - it's more erratic, containing heavy pitch tuning and adlibs. Little vocal samples are sprinkled in as well. This track was unpredictable in that the bridge felt as if it would build back up to the pace of the chorus - but it didn't. Instead, the track took a totally different direction. These production elements and BamBam's soft, yet powerful cadence holds it together. In the music video, "riBBon" references the wrapping of a present, but, in the song, it's most consistently pronounced as a play on "reborn" (apart from the direct reference to untying it). The lyrics are characteristic of a lovey-dovey ballad, but they represent the better version of himself and his music that he seeks to create after departing from JYP Entertainment - his artistic rebirth.  It's definitely something special! I haven't seen ANYTHING like it this year.

- ckr"Next Level" - aespaOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
After already being heralded as "monster rookies" thanks to their November 2020 song "Black Mamba," aespa truly shine on follow-up single "Next Level," which reimagines A$ton Wyld’s 2019 song of the same name. While "Black Mamba" served as more of an intro to aespa’s half-digital concept, "Next Level" lets Giselle and Karina show off their rap skills while Ningning and Winter highlight their fluttering vocals, with different sections of the song taking inspiration from different genres. It’s proof that the success of "Black Mamba" was more than just beginner’s luck, and that aespa is here to stay as one of the most promising new girl groups.

- VinylZombie_MCR"Film out" - BTSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Not everyone knows it, but BTS are masters in creating atmospheric soundtracks, and so it was this time. "Film out" is the fourth BTS' song made for the Japanese cinematography (after "Don't Leave Me," "Stay Gold," and "Your Eyes Tell"), and acts as the main theme for the film Signal: Long-Term Unsolved Case Investigation Team. This moving ballad, co-written by Jung Kook, really shows off their vocal abilities and proves that they can sing and rap in any language—the harmonies, the flows, not a single one feeling out of place in the song. The song is filled with emotions and soulful vocals, and I'm sure it'll have a special place in many hearts. Despite being sung in Japanese, it has topped the charts in over 100 countries, including the world's biggest music markets, such as the US, Japan, and the UK.
- Siannve"Fireworks (I'm The One)" - ATEEZOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Being the second entry in their ZERO: FEVER series, ATEEZ truly did not disappoint! As being part of their sort of "tradition" with the title tracks, "Fireworks (I'm The One)" was teased at the end of the preceding single, "THANXX". It just left us wanting to hear more of the song before it was even out! And man we were in for a treat! The title track has an EDM rhythm over the trap beat, and the lyrics really are fire! They aim to burn their own ashes from the false perceptions of the world to make a real fire (like in the concept photos of a dreamy world vs the burning underworld). Also loved seeing Hongjoong and Mingi participated in the songwriting for the track! Definitely, one to blast when you want to feel powerful!

- Hobschiske"End of the World" - EPIK HIGHOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
The golden voice of Korea (puns intended) teamed up with my favorite South Korean trio, Epik High, to sing this ballad, which is one of the best songs on Epik High Is Here 上, despite that the album is packed with high-quality music. The song asks, 'What if the end of the world comes? What will be the most important then?' what hits harder in uncertain times we are living in now. The rough rap of the questions asked paired with GSoul's soothing vocals really hits differently, and makes it feel even nostalgic. But this song, contrary to appearances, is not sad, and the conclusion is that after all, you have to dream, love and live life to the fullest, as if there was no tomorrow, even if the world is dark and things seems out of control.

- Siannve"꼬리 (TAIL)" - SUNMIOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
In 2019, legendary Korean diva and superstar, Uhm Jung Hwa, said in an interview that if she can see someone continuing her legacy, it would be Sunmi. With explosive sensuality on her 2021 single, "꼬리 (TAIL)," Sunmi definitely proved her right. I have loved Sunmi’s singles ever since she debuted in 2013 with "24시간이 모자라 (24 Hours)." With her recent singles, Sunmi grew popular as a witty lyricist with quirky songs and music videos. But with "꼬리 (TAIL)" Sunmi went back to her sultry second-generation sound and style bringing back the heat. Guitar riffs and looming vintage sound samples make the song an instant earworm with a sexy aura amplified by the equally sexy choreography. With "꼬리 (TAIL)," I think Sunmi is stepping into an even more mature image and establishing herself as a diva in the K-Pop industry.

- ssaa10dec"Joker" - BIG Naughty ft. JAMIEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
"Joker" is easily one of the best Korean songs this year. It was my first time hearing BIG Naughty, and the soulful guitar and emotional voice hooked me up instantly. In this bittersweet track, BIG Naughty sings about being head over heels for a girl who isn't serious about him. The concept is summed up in my favorite lines, "Even if I were a king or queen, I cannot defeat you 'cause you are the joker and I've already fallen for you." BIG Naughty also offers the other party's perspective with JAMIE's feature, explaining that she's just in it for the fun. With both sides of the story and expressive performances, the song is brought to life like a movie.

- EleventhCassette"치맛바람 (Chi Mat Ba Ram)" - Brave GirlsOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Brave Girls' story is probably the most heartwarming thing to happen in K-pop this year: on the verge of disbandment after years of poor recognition, the group unexpectedly found late success with their 2017 tropical pop song "Rollin'" going viral and breaking records; turning them into the hottest girl group of 2021 and strong contenders for the 'summer queens' position left vacant by SISTAR. Now that all eyes are on them, expectations were high for their comeback, and "Chi Mat Ba Ram" did not disappoint: while sharing the same high energy and top-quality production of "Rollin'", it is far from being a pale copy and succeeds at giving off a different vibe, highlighting even better each member's charms. Reminiscent of second-gen girl groups songs, it stills feels very now and sets up an exciting summer mood from the get-go. As they confidently sing "We're gonna be summer queens, yeah", I couldn't think of a more deserving group to take on this spot.

- ab212"Lock Down" - EPEXOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
What you'll notice when listening to "Lock Down" is the high-energy trap instrumental and smooth rapping. It seems like a braggadocious celebration of a lavish lifestyle on first listen - and you'd be forgiven to think so. But what you'll discover as you look into the lyrics is that it's a critique of the worship of wealth and unrealistic expectations that social media (such as Instagram) cultivates. The title clearly references COVID lockdowns, which further exacerbated these problems as people turned to the internet for most or all social interaction. People often present the best parts of their life - or "mask up." While this can be taken literally with the normalcy of face masks, it acts as more of a metaphor for the image seen on social media. EPEX tackles how this damages mental health - fostering envy, jealousy, and hatred. Influencers oftentimes value brands and interesting drama to keep people enticed over meaningful friendships. But this isn't their fault. In fact, it refers to social media companies as "Big Brother" manipulating you (for example, the dopamine from receiving comments, likes, or other interaction). It maximizes engagement, on purpose, to an obsessive level. The question it begs is: what are you willing to sacrifice for money, fame, and social validation? People who don't cave are left hopeless because so many do. Nowadays, someone's life can be entertainment like never before with every little thing recorded and documented for the world. "Lock Down" is amazing in presentation and production (which I usually praise), but the deep lyrical complexity is something remarkable. This is paired with the refreshing fact that a rookie group is targeting such a serious issue on debut.

- ckr"Nerves" - DPR IANOriginal Song | Korean Translation
If I had the option to write about every song in MITO, I honestly would—the album is just perfect from start to finish. I ended up choosing "Nerves" because the songwriting is absolutely genius (No pun intended). Like the title hints, DPR IAN expresses his nervousness through repetitive phrases and self-convincing. It's almost like trying to write a risky text, where you keep erasing and changing your words due to insecurity. After hitting 'SEND', you end up in regret for not saying your true feelings.

- EleventhCassette"우리의 계절 (My Youth)" - NCT DREAMOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
"우리의 계절 (My Youth)" is my favorite song out of NCT DREAM's first full-length album; not only does it include beautiful joyful vocals that the members can very smoothly execute live while making it look like they ate the CD before performing it, but it also features the slight hint of nostalgia that nobody but NCT DREAM can do. Being a long-time fan of the group, I can't deny that the sentimental lyrics hit close to home as they made me realize that all of this time, as I left my teenage years and went into adulthood while supporting them, I've also been sharing my youth and growing up with them. Accompanied by a chill electro-pop sound that enhances the group's signature youthful concept, "우리의 계절 (My Youth)" is a sweet reminder of how we can finally see them all together yet again, making new memories while prospering, breaking new records, and sharing their journey with us, their fans.

- loveholic"Odd Eye" - DREAMCATCHEROriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
In late January, DREAMCATCHER came back in full force with their title track "Odd Eye" from their EP Dystopia: Road To Utopia, the end of their 'Dystopia' trilogy. "Odd Eye" starts off with strong and mysterious melodies, the lyrics portraying how humans keep chasing a perfect world that doesn't exist—a Utopia. The pre-chorus builds the song up with haunting synth sounds until the chorus drops with one of the coolest guitar riffs ever. As a breaker, Dami's rap verse has a more electronic vibe, and my favorite lyrics in the song, "Struggling with meaninglessness, we seemed to be in the same place again with endless thirst. No matter how you chase a mirage, it's not there." In the bridge, I always imagine that's how DREAMCATCHER would sound like after a big explosion, a breaking point where they've realized their reality and lost all hope. I love the choreography at this part, leading to the girls' powerful spinning jump in the last chorus. Vocally, the highlights there are Yoohyeon's and Siyeons's harmonies and backing vocals, landing the song to a breathtaking end. Besides the musical aspect of the track, the music video for "Odd Eye" is the best film release of DREAMCATCHER so far. The girl group has always had great music video concepts, but now they've perfected them with amazing direction, special effects, artsy sets, and cyberpunk imagery. With the conclusion of the 'Dystopia' series, I can't wait to see what else DREAMCATCHER has in store for us.

- EleventhCassette"Don't Fight The Feeling" - EXOOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Undoubtedly my excitement had been reaching new heights ever since EXO’s comeback was announced in April. LAY’s involvement in the project amplified it further. “Don’t Fight The Feeling” is a perfect comeback title track. While I love EXO’s experimental tracks like “Tempo” and “Obsession,” I was longing for a simple dance-pop track from the group. The song and its colorful music video is one giant dance party and gave me the same feeling as when I heard their 2018 anthem, "Power" or their 2015 bop, "Love Me Right." A very easy listen, the song is perfect for everyone’s summer playlists. With lyrics about enjoying life on your own terms, the new song, and its parent album, EXO once again prove that they can still have fun while being sincere.

- ssaa10dec"Healer" - DAY6Original Song | Romanization | English Translation
At first glance, the title “Healer” might hint at a soothing, mellow song … but what follows is a musical surprise that is pure joy to listen to! DAY6 is renowned for consistently delivering hits, and “Healer” is no exception. With an up-tempo and bright sound, “Healer” mixes electropop and rock (along with some DAY6 magic) and simultaneously manages to make the listener feel soothed and energized all at once. Young K’s lyrics perfectly encapsulate the effects of someone’s healing presence in your life. Lagging in energy? Feeling down? Missing someone? Or feeling good about life? Listen to “Healer” (on repeat)! Caution: head-bopping may ensue. “Healer” is my most played song thus far in 2021 and is apt to retain that title for the rest of the year. Thank you DAY6 for this soothing, healing, and energizing song!

- minnowli"왜왜왜 (Why Why Why)" - iKONOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Even though iKON is known for their crazy banging hip-hop tracks, I expected “왜왜왜 (Why Why Why)” to be a complete ballad. However, they delivered one of 2021’s best heartbreak anthems without it being a piano ballad. I am a sucker for angsty boy group songs and iKON shared one of the best songs of their career. The track was an instant throwback to old YG ballads. With an absolutely beautiful melody, an emotive rap verse by Bobby, sleek choreography, and somber music video, “왜왜왜 (Why Why Why)” has the longevity of most iKON songs. I believe I will revisit this track in a few years and fall in love with it all over again. I also hope iKON gains a renewed popularity following their appearance on KINGDOM.

- ssaa10dec"PTT (Paint The Town)" - LOONAOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
"PTT (Paint The Town)" is probably the song that I was most excited about so far this year (alongside "Like It Hot" by GWSN). It was really exciting since member Haseul, who was put on hiatus for over a year, was returning. This was my first comeback with her and it definitely made me like the song more. The song features a catchy Bollywood instrumental and honestly was really different from what I expected. The bridge along with the pre-chorus were the best parts of the song in my opinion. I also adore the part that Go Won and Vivi share. There is also a Japanese version of the song, so if you enjoy listening to J-pop more, I would recommend that version. The chorus has an easy-to-listen beat drop which compliments the piece a lot. The lyrics to this song provide confidence as LOONA always has inspiring lyrics that will make you feel like a badass. "PTT (Paint The Town)" is a song that I'd recommend if you enjoy strong concepts.

- seokyoung"Spider" - HOSHIOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
It is kind of hard for me to believe that “Spider” is Hoshi’s first proper solo release. Hoshi’s command throughout the song and the track’s ability to lure in its listeners like a spider to its prey is one of the many reasons why I love the song. Weaved over a sultry electric guitar, “Spider” lets Hoshi shine not only as a performer but also as a vocalist. With 13 members in the group, Seventeen songs often struggle with the vocal part distribution. With a solo release, Hoshi is once again able to remind listeners of his talent as a singer. The music video and the song’s insane choreography are other highlights of this debut for me. From his forehead (God bless his stylist) to the upside-down acrobatics, the music video was filled with moments that fans can instantly fall in love with. With “Spider,” Hoshi proves why he was chosen as the performance leader in Seventeen and also makes his impact as a soloist with tremendous potential.

- ssaa10dec"Giant"/"Bonnie & Clyde" - YuqiOriginal Song | Chinese Translation
“Giant” and “Bonnie & Clyde” were the first solo songs I listened to by a (G)-IDLE member and I was blown away. Yuqi's first single album featuring the rock-inspired song, "Giant" and disco-pop, "Bonnie & Clyde" perfectly showcase her powerful vocals and husky voice. The build-up to the chorus in “Giant” gives just the right amount of suspense to draw the listener in while leaving them yearning for more. I love how the chorus’ lyrics, while repetitive, can be seen as a mantra for anyone struggling and it’s paired with a strong beat — giving the song a powerful fighting spirit. Contrasting “Giant”, the EDM-trance track, “Bonnie & Clyde” incorporates haunting energy that leads to a power-packed chorus. A set of chords pulse throughout the song giving it looping energy that makes the song so addictive.

The question tonight, as I understand it, is "The Negro Revolt, and Where Do We Go From Here?" or What Next?" In my little humble way of understanding it, it points toward either the ballot or the bullet.

Before we try and explain what is meant by the ballot or the bullet, I would like to clarify something concerning myself. I'm still a Muslim; my religion is still Islam. That's my personal belief. Just as Adam Clayton Powell is a Christian minister who heads the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, but at the same time takes part in the political struggles to try and bring about rights to the black people in this country; and Dr. Martin Luther King is a Christian minister down in Atlanta, Georgia, who heads another organization fighting for the civil rights of black people in this country; and Reverend Galamison, I guess you've heard of him, is another Christian minister in New York who has been deeply involved in the school boycotts to eliminate segregated education; well, I myself am a minister, not a Christian minister, but a Muslim minister; and I believe in action on all fronts by whatever means necessary.

Although I'm still a Muslim, I'm not here tonight to discuss my religion. I'm not here to try and change your religion. I'm not here to argue or discuss anything that we differ about, because it's time for us to submerge our differences and realize that it is best for us to first see that we have the same problem, a common problem, a problem that will make you catch hell whether you're a Baptist, or a Methodist, or a Muslim, or a nationalist. Whether you're educated or illiterate, whether you live on the boulevard or in the alley, you're going to catch hell just like I am. We're all in the same boat and we all are going to catch the same hell from the same man. He just happens to be a white man. All of us have suffered here, in this country, political oppression at the hands of the white man, economic exploitation at the hands of the white man, and social degradation at the hands of the white man.

Now in speaking like this, it doesn't mean that we're anti-white, but it does mean we're anti-exploitation, we're anti-degradation, we're anti-oppression. And if the white man doesn't want us to be anti-him, let him stop oppressing and exploiting and degrading us. Whether we are Christians or Muslims or nationalists or agnostics or atheists, we must first learn to forget our differences. If we have differences, let us differ in the closet; when we come out in front, let us not have anything to argue about until we get finished arguing with the man. If the late President Kennedy could get together with Khrushchev and exchange some wheat, we certainly have more in common with each other than Kennedy and Khrushchev had with each other.

If we don't do something real soon, I think you'll have to agree that we're going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet. It's one or the other in 1964. It isn't that time is running out -- time has run out!

1964 threatens to be the most explosive year America has ever witnessed. The most explosive year. Why? It's also a political year. It's the year when all of the white politicians will be back in the so-called Negro community jiving you and me for some votes. The year when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false promises, building up our hopes for a letdown, with their trickery and their treachery, with their false promises which they don't intend to keep. As they nourish these dissatisfactions, it can only lead to one thing, an explosion; and now we have the type of black man on the scene in America today -- I'm sorry, Brother Lomax -- who just doesn't intend to turn the other cheek any longer.
Don't let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you. If they draft you, they send you to Korea and make you face 800 million Chinese. If you can be brave over there, you can be brave right here. These odds aren't as great as those odds. And if you fight here, you will at least know what you're fighting for.

I'm not a politician, not even a student of politics; in fact, I'm not a student of much of anything. I'm not a Democrat. I'm not a Republican, and I don't even consider myself an American. If you and I were Americans, there'd be no problem. Those Honkies that just got off the boat, they're already Americans; Polacks are already Americans; the Italian refugees are already Americans. Everything that came out of Europe, every blue-eyed thing, is already an American. And as long as you and I have been over here, we aren't Americans yet.

Well, I am one who doesn't believe in deluding myself. I'm not going to sit at your table and watch you eat, with nothing on my plate, and call myself a diner. Sitting at the table doesn't make you a diner, unless you eat some of what's on that plate. Being here in America doesn't make you an American. Being born here in America doesn't make you an American. Why, if birth made you American, you wouldn't need any legislation; you wouldn't need any amendments to the Constitution; you wouldn't be faced with civil-rights filibustering in Washington, D.C., right now. They don't have to pass civil-rights legislation to make a Polack an American.

No, I'm not an American. I'm one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of Americanism. One of the 22 million black people who are the victims of democracy, nothing but disguised hypocrisy. So, I'm not standing here speaking to you as an American, or a patriot, or a flag-saluter, or a flag-waver -- no, not I. I'm speaking as a victim of this American system. And I see America through the eyes of the victim. I don't see any American dream; I see an American nightmare.

These 22 million victims are waking up. Their eyes are coming open. They're beginning to see what they used to only look at. They're becoming politically mature. They are realizing that there are new political trends from coast to coast. As they see these new political trends, it's possible for them to see that every time there's an election the races are so close that they have to have a recount. They had to recount in Massachusetts to see who was going to be governor, it was so close. It was the same way in Rhode Island, in Minnesota, and in many other parts of the country. And the same with Kennedy and Nixon when they ran for president. It was so close they had to count all over again. Well, what does this mean? It means that when white people are evenly divided, and black people have a bloc of votes of their own, it is left up to them to determine who's going to sit in the White House and who's going to be in the dog house.

Lt. was the black man's vote that put the present administration in Washington, D.C. Your vote, your dumb vote, your ignorant vote, your wasted vote put in an administration in Washington, D.C., that has seen fit to pass every kind of legislation imaginable, saving you until last, then filibustering on top of that. And your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress we're making. And what a good president we have. If he wasn't good in Texas, he sure can't be good in Washington, D.C. Because Texas is a lynch state. It is in the same breath as Mississippi, no different; only they lynch you in Texas with a Texas accent and lynch you in Mississippi with a Mississippi accent. And these Negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some coffee in the White House with a Texan, a Southern cracker -- that's all he is -- and then come out and tell you and me that he's going to be better for us because, since he's from the South, he knows how to deal with the Southerners. What kind of logic is that? Let Eastland be president, he's from the South too. He should be better able to deal with them than Johnson.

In this present administration they have in the House of Representatives 257 Democrats to only 177 Republicans. They control two-thirds of the House vote. Why can't they pass something that will help you and me? In the Senate, there are 67 senators who are of the Democratic Party. Only 33 of them are Republicans. Why, the Democrats have got the government sewed up, and you're the one who sewed it up for them. And what have they given you for it? Four years in office, and just now getting around to some civil-rights legislation. Just now, after everything else is gone, out of the way, they're going to sit down now and play with you all summer long -- the same old giant con game that they call filibuster. All those are in cahoots together. Don't you ever think they're not in cahoots together, for the man that is heading the civil-rights filibuster is a man from Georgia named Richard Russell. When Johnson became president, the first man he asked for when he got back to Washington, D.C., was "Dicky" -- that's how tight they are. That's his boy, that's his pal, that's his buddy. But they're playing that old con game. One of them makes believe he's for you, and he's got it fixed where the other one is so tight against you, he never has to keep his promise.

So it's time in 1964 to wake up. And when you see them coming up with that kind of conspiracy, let them know your eyes are open. And let them know you -- something else that's wide open too. It's got to be the ballot or the bullet. The ballot or the bullet. If you're afraid to use an expression like that, you should get on out of the country; you should get back in the cotton patch; you should get back in the alley. They get all the Negro vote, and after they get it, the Negro gets nothing in return. All they did when they got to Washington was give a few big Negroes big jobs. Those big Negroes didn't need big jobs, they already had jobs. That's camouflage, that's trickery, that's treachery, window-dressing. I'm not trying to knock out the Democrats for the Republicans. We'll get to them in a minute. But it is true; you put the Democrats first and the Democrats put you last.

Look at it the way it is. What alibis do they use, since they control Congress and the Senate? What alibi do they use when you and I ask, "Well, when are you going to keep your promise?" They blame the Dixiecrats. What is a Dixiecrat? A Democrat. A Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat in disguise. The titular head of the Democrats is also the head of the Dixiecrats, because the Dixiecrats are a part of the Democratic Party. The Democrats have never kicked the Dixiecrats out of the party. The Dixiecrats bolted themselves once, but the Democrats didn't put them out. Imagine, these lowdown Southern segregationists put the Northern Democrats down. But the Northern Democrats have never put the Dixiecrats down. No, look at that thing the way it is. They have got a con game going on, a political con game, and you and I are in the middle. It's time for you and me to wake up and start looking at it like it is, and trying to understand it like it is; and then we can deal with it like it is.

The Dixiecrats in Washington, D.C., control the key committees that run the government. The only reason the Dixiecrats control these committees is because they have seniority. The only reason they have seniority is because they come from states where Negroes can't vote. This is not even a government that's based on democracy. lt. is not a government that is made up of representatives of the people. Half of the people in the South can't even vote. Eastland is not even supposed to be in Washington. Half of the senators and congressmen who occupy these key positions in Washington, D.C., are there illegally, are there unconstitutionally.

I was in Washington, D.C., a week ago Thursday, when they were debating whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor. And in the back of the room where the Senate meets, there's a huge map of the United States, and on that map it shows the location of Negroes throughout the country. And it shows that the Southern section of the country, the states that are most heavily concentrated with Negroes, are the ones that have senators and congressmen standing up filibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery to keep the Negro from being able to vote. This is pitiful. But it's not pitiful for us any longer; it's actually pitiful for the white man, because soon now, as the Negro awakens a little more and sees the vise that he's in, sees the bag that he's in, sees the real game that he's in, then the Negro's going to develop a new tactic.

These senators and congressmen actually violate the constitutional amendments that guarantee the people of that particular state or county the right to vote. And the Constitution itself has within it the machinery to expel any representative from a state where the voting rights of the people are violated. You don't even need new legislation. Any person in Congress right now, who is there from a state or a district where the voting rights of the people are violated, that particular person should be expelled from Congress. And when you expel him, you've removed one of the obstacles in the path of any real meaningful legislation in this country. In fact, when you expel them, you don't need new legislation, because they will be replaced by black representatives from counties and districts where the black man is in the majority, not in the minority.

If the black man in these Southern states had his full voting rights, the key Dixiecrats in Washington, D. C., which means the key Democrats in Washington, D.C., would lose their seats. The Democratic Party itself would lose its power. It would cease to be powerful as a party. When you see the amount of power that would be lost by the Democratic Party if it were to lose the Dixiecrat wing, or branch, or element, you can see where it's against the interests of the Democrats to give voting rights to Negroes in states where the Democrats have been in complete power and authority ever since the Civil War. You just can't belong to that Party without analyzing it.
I say again, I'm not anti-Democrat, I'm not anti-Republican, I'm not anti-anything. I'm just questioning their sincerity, and some of the strategy that they've been using on our people by promising them promises that they don't intend to keep. When you keep the Democrats in power, you're keeping the Dixiecrats in power. I doubt that my good Brother Lomax will deny that. A vote for a Democrat is a vote for a Dixiecrat. That's why, in 1964, it's time now for you and me to become more politically mature and realize what the ballot is for; what we're supposed to get when we cast a ballot; and that if we don't cast a ballot, it's going to end up in a situation where we're going to have to cast a bullet. It's either a ballot or a bullet.

In the North, they do it a different way. They have a system that's known as gerrymandering, whatever that means. It means when Negroes become too heavily concentrated in a certain area, and begin to gain too much political power, the white man comes along and changes the district lines. You may say, "Why do you keep saying white man?" Because it's the white man who does it. I haven't ever seen any Negro changing any lines. They don't let him get near the line. It's the white man who does this. And usually, it's the white man who grins at you the most, and pats you on the back, and is supposed to be your friend. He may be friendly, but he's not your friend.

So, what I'm trying to impress upon you, in essence, is this: You and I in America are faced not with a segregationist conspiracy, we're faced with a government conspiracy. Everyone who's filibustering is a senator -- that's the government. Everyone who's finagling in Washington, D.C., is a congressman -- that's the government. You don't have anybody putting blocks in your path but people who are a part of the government. The same government that you go abroad to fight for and die for is the government that is in a conspiracy to deprive you of your voting rights, deprive you of your economic opportunities, deprive you of decent housing, deprive you of decent education. You don't need to go to the employer alone, it is the government itself, the government of America, that is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of black people in this country. And you should drop it in their lap. This government has failed the Negro. This so-called democracy has failed the Negro. And all these white liberals have definitely failed the Negro.

So, where do we go from here? First, we need some friends. We need some new allies. The entire civil-rights struggle needs a new interpretation, a broader interpretation. We need to look at this civil-rights thing from another angle -- from the inside as well as from the outside. To those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism, the only way you can get involved in the civil-rights struggle is give it a new interpretation. That old interpretation excluded us. It kept us out. So, we're giving a new interpretation to the civil-rights struggle, an interpretation that will enable us to come into it, take part in it. And these handkerchief-heads who have been dillydallying and pussy footing and compromising -- we don't intend to let them pussyfoot and dillydally and compromise any longer.

How can you thank a man for giving you what's already yours? How then can you thank him for giving you only part of what's already yours? You haven't even made progress, if what's being given to you, you should have had already. That's not progress. And I love my Brother Lomax, the way he pointed out we're right back where we were in 1954. We're not even as far up as we were in 1954. We're behind where we were in 1954. There's more segregation now than there was in 1954. There's more racial animosity, more racial hatred, more racial violence today in 1964, than there was in 1954. Where is the progress?

And now you're facing a situation where the young Negro's coming up. They don't want to hear that "turn the-other-cheek" stuff, no. In Jacksonville, those were teenagers, they were throwing Molotov cocktails. Negroes have never done that before. But it shows you there's a new deal coming in. There's new thinking coming in. There's new strategy coming in. It'll be Molotov cocktails this month, hand grenades next month, and something else next month. It'll be ballots, or it'll be bullets. It'll be liberty, or it will be death. The only difference about this kind of death -- it'll be reciprocal. You know what is meant by "reciprocal"? That's one of Brother Lomax's words. I stole it from him. I don't usually deal with those big words because I don't usually deal with big people. I deal with small people. I find you can get a whole lot of small people and whip hell out of a whole lot of big people. They haven't got anything to lose, and they've got every thing to gain. And they'll let you know in a minute: "It takes two to tango; when I go, you go."

The black nationalists, those whose philosophy is black nationalism, in bringing about this new interpretation of the entire meaning of civil rights, look upon it as meaning, as Brother Lomax has pointed out, equality of opportunity. Well, we're justified in seeking civil rights, if it means equality of opportunity, because all we're doing there is trying to collect for our investment. Our mothers and fathers invested sweat and blood. Three hundred and ten years we worked in this country without a dime in return -- I mean without a dime in return. You let the white man walk around here talking about how rich this country is, but you never stop to think how it got rich so quick. It got rich because you made it rich.

You take the people who are in this audience right now. They're poor. We're all poor as individuals. Our weekly salary individually amounts to hardly anything. But if you take the salary of everyone in here collectively, it'll fill up a whole lot of baskets. It's a lot of wealth. If you can collect the wages of just these people right here for a year, you'll be rich -- richer than rich. When you look at it like that, think how rich Uncle Sam had to become, not with this handful, but millions of black people. Your and my mother and father, who didn't work an eight-hour shift, but worked from "can't see" in the morning until "can't see" at night, and worked for nothing, making the white man rich, making Uncle Sam rich. This is our investment. This is our contribution, our blood.

Not only did we give of our free labor, we gave of our blood. Every time he had a call to arms, we were the first ones in uniform. We died on every battlefield the white man had. We have made a greater sacrifice than anybody who's standing up in America today. We have made a greater contribution and have collected less. Civil rights, for those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism, means: "Give it to us now. Don't wait for next year. Give it to us yesterday, and that's not fast enough."

I might stop right here to point out one thing. Whenever you're going after something that belongs to you, anyone who's depriving you of the right to have it is a criminal. Understand that. Whenever you are going after something that is yours, you are within your legal rights to lay claim to it. And anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that which is yours, is breaking the law, is a criminal. And this was pointed out by the Supreme Court decision. It outlawed segregation.

Which means segregation is against the law. Which means a segregationist is breaking the law. A segregationist is a criminal. You can't label him as anything other than that. And when you demonstrate against segregation, the law is on your side. The Supreme Court is on your side.

Now, who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law? The police department itself. With police dogs and clubs. Whenever you demonstrate against segregation, whether it is segregated education, segregated housing, or anything else, the law is on your side, and anyone who stands in the way is not the law any longer. They are breaking the law; they are not representatives of the law. Any time you demonstrate against segregation and a man has the audacity to put a police dog on you, kill that dog, kill him, I'm telling you, kill that dog. I say it, if they put me in jail tomorrow, kill that dog. Then you'll put a stop to it. Now, if these white people in here don't want to see that kind of action, get down and tell the mayor to tell the police department to pull the dogs in. That's all you have to do. If you don't do it, someone else will.

If you don't take this kind of stand, your little children will grow up and look at you and think "shame." If you don't take an uncompromising stand, I don't mean go out and get violent; but at the same time you should never be nonviolent unless you run into some nonviolence. I'm nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me. But when you drop that violence on me, then you've made me go insane, and I'm not responsible for what I do. And that's the way every Negro should get. Any time you know you're within the law, within your legal rights, within your moral rights, in accord with justice, then die for what you believe in. But don't die alone. Let your dying be reciprocal. This is what is meant by equality. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
When we begin to get in this area, we need new friends, we need new allies. We need to expand the civil-rights struggle to a higher level -- to the level of human rights. Whenever you are in a civil-rights struggle, whether you know it or not, you are confining yourself to the jurisdiction of Uncle Sam. No one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is a civil-rights struggle. Civil rights comes within the domestic affairs of this country. All of our African brothers and our Asian brothers and our Latin-American brothers cannot open their mouths and interfere in the domestic affairs of the United States. And as long as it's civil rights, this comes under the jurisdiction of Uncle Sam.

But the United Nations has what's known as the charter of human rights; it has a committee that deals in human rights. You may wonder why all of the atrocities that have been committed in Africa and in Hungary and in Asia, and in Latin America are brought before the UN, and the Negro problem is never brought before the UN. This is part of the conspiracy. This old, tricky blue eyed liberal who is supposed to be your and my friend, supposed to be in our corner, supposed to be subsidizing our struggle, and supposed to be acting in the capacity of an adviser, never tells you anything about human rights. They keep you wrapped up in civil rights. And you spend so much time barking up the civil-rights tree, you don't even know there's a human-rights tree on the same floor.

When you expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights, you can then take the case of the black man in this country before the nations in the UN. You can take it before the General Assembly. You can take Uncle Sam before a world court. But the only level you can do it on is the level of human rights. Civil rights keeps you under his restrictions, under his jurisdiction. Civil rights keeps you in his pocket. Civil rights means you're asking Uncle Sam to treat you right. Human rights are something you were born with. Human rights are your God-given rights. Human rights are the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth. And any time any one violates your human rights, you can take them to the world court.

Uncle Sam's hands are dripping with blood, dripping with the blood of the black man in this country. He's the earth's number-one hypocrite. He has the audacity -- yes, he has -- imagine him posing as the leader of the free world. The free world! And you over here singing "We Shall Overcome." Expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights. Take it into the United Nations, where our African brothers can throw their weight on our side, where our Asian brothers can throw their weight on our side, where our Latin-American brothers can throw their weight on our side, and where 800 million Chinamen are sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side.

Let the world know how bloody his hands are. Let the world know the hypocrisy that's practiced over here. Let it be the ballot or the bullet. Let him know that it must be the ballot or the bullet.

When you take your case to Washington, D.C., you're taking it to the criminal who's responsible; it's like running from the wolf to the fox. They're all in cahoots together. They all work political chicanery and make you look like a chump before the eyes of the world. Here you are walking around in America, getting ready to be drafted and sent abroad, like a tin soldier, and when you get over there, people ask you what are you fighting for, and you have to stick your tongue in your cheek. No, take Uncle Sam to court, take him before the world.

By ballot I only mean freedom. Don't you know -- I disagree with Lomax on this issue -- that the ballot is more important than the dollar? Can I prove it? Yes. Look in the UN. There are poor nations in the UN; yet those poor nations can get together with their voting power and keep the rich nations from making a move. They have one nation -- one vote, everyone has an equal vote. And when those brothers from Asia, and Africa and the darker parts of this earth get together, their voting power is sufficient to hold Sam in check. Or Russia in check. Or some other section of the earth in check. So, the ballot is most important.

Right now, in this country, if you and I, 22 million African-Americans -- that's what we are -- Africans who are in America. You're nothing but Africans. Nothing but Africans. In fact, you'd get farther calling yourself African instead of Negro. Africans don't catch hell. You're the only one catching hell. They don't have to pass civil-rights bills for Africans. An African can go anywhere he wants right now. All you've got to do is tie your head up. That's right, go anywhere you want. Just stop being a Negro. Change your name to Hoogagagooba. That'll show you how silly the white man is. You're dealing with a silly man. A friend of mine who's very dark put a turban on his head and went into a restaurant in Atlanta before they called themselves desegregated. He went into a white restaurant, he sat down, they served him, and he said, "What would happen if a Negro came in here? And there he's sitting, black as night, but because he had his head wrapped up the waitress looked back at him and says, "Why, there wouldn't no nigger dare come in here."

So, you're dealing with a man whose bias and prejudice are making him lose his mind, his intelligence, every day. He's frightened. He looks around and sees what's taking place on this earth, and he sees that the pendulum of time is swinging in your direction. The dark people are waking up. They're losing their fear of the white man. No place where he's fighting right now is he winning. Everywhere he's fighting, he's fighting someone your and my complexion. And they're beating him. He can't win any more. He's won his last battle. He failed to win the Korean War. He couldn't win it. He had to sign a truce. That's a loss.

Any time Uncle Sam, with all his machinery for warfare, is held to a draw by some rice eaters, he's lost the battle. He had to sign a truce. America's not supposed to sign a truce. She's supposed to be bad. But she's not bad any more. She's bad as long as she can use her hydrogen bomb, but she can't use hers for fear Russia might use hers. Russia can't use hers, for fear that Sam might use his. So, both of them are weapon-less. They can't use the weapon because each's weapon nullifies the other's. So the only place where action can take place is on the ground. And the white man can't win another war fighting on the ground. Those days are over The black man knows it, the brown man knows it, the red man knows it, and the yellow man knows it. So they engage him in guerrilla warfare. That's not his style. You've got to have heart to be a guerrilla warrior, and he hasn't got any heart. I'm telling you now.

I just want to give you a little briefing on guerrilla warfare because, before you know it, before you know it. It takes heart to be a guerrilla warrior because you're on your own. In conventional warfare you have tanks and a whole lot of other people with you to back you up -- planes over your head and all that kind of stuff. But a guerrilla is on his own. All you have is a rifle, some sneakers and a bowl of rice, and that's all you need -- and a lot of heart. The Japanese on some of those islands in the Pacific, when the American soldiers landed, one Japanese sometimes could hold the whole army off. He'd just wait until the sun went down, and when the sun went down they were all equal. He would take his little blade and slip from bush to bush, and from American to American. The white soldiers couldn't cope with that. Whenever you see a white soldier that fought in the Pacific, he has the shakes, he has a nervous condition, because they scared him to death.

The same thing happened to the French up in French Indochina. People who just a few years previously were rice farmers got together and ran the heavily-mechanized French army out of Indochina. You don't need it -- modern warfare today won't work. This is the day of the guerrilla. They did the same thing in Algeria. Algerians, who were nothing but Bedouins, took a rine and sneaked off to the hills, and de Gaulle and all of his highfalutin' war machinery couldn't defeat those guerrillas. Nowhere on this earth does the white man win in a guerrilla warfare. It's not his speed. Just as guerrilla warfare is prevailing in Asia and in parts of Africa and in parts of Latin America, you've got to be mighty naive, or you've got to play the black man cheap, if you don't think some day he's going to wake up and find that it's got to be the ballot or the bullet.

L would like to say, in closing, a few things concerning the Muslim Mosque, Inc., which we established recently in New York City. It's true we're Muslims and our religion is Islam, but we don't mix our religion with our politics and our economics and our social and civil activities -- not any more We keep our religion in our mosque. After our religious services are over, then as Muslims we become involved in political action, economic action and social and civic action. We become involved with anybody, any where, any time and in any manner that's designed to eliminate the evils, the political, economic and social evils that are afflicting the people of our community.

The political philosophy of black nationalism means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community; no more. The black man in the black community has to be re-educated into the science of politics so he will know what politics is supposed to bring him in return. Don't be throwing out any ballots. A ballot is like a bullet. You don't throw your ballots until you see a target, and if that target is not within your reach, keep your ballot in your pocket.

The political philosophy of black nationalism is being taught in the Christian church. It's being taught in the NAACP. It's being taught in CORE meetings. It's being taught in SNCC Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee meetings. It's being taught in Muslim meetings. It's being taught where nothing but atheists and agnostics come together. It's being taught everywhere. Black people are fed up with the dillydallying, pussyfooting, compromising approach that we've been using toward getting our freedom. We want freedom now, but we're not going to get it saying "We Shall Overcome." We've got to fight until we overcome.

The economic philosophy of black nationalism is pure and simple. It only means that we should control the economy of our community. Why should white people be running all the stores in our community? Why should white people be running the banks of our community? Why should the economy of our community be in the hands of the white man? Why? If a black man can't move his store into a white community, you tell me why a white man should move his store into a black community. The philosophy of black nationalism involves a re-education program in the black community in regards to economics. Our people have to be made to see that any time you take your dollar out of your community and spend it in a community where you don't live, the community where you live will get poorer and poorer, and the community where you spend your money will get richer and richer.

Then you wonder why where you live is always a ghetto or a slum area. And where you and I are concerned, not only do we lose it when we spend it out of the community, but the white man has got all our stores in the community tied up; so that though we spend it in the community, at sundown the man who runs the store takes it over across town somewhere. He's got us in a vise. So the economic philosophy of black nationalism means in every church, in every civic organization, in every fraternal order, it's time now for our people to be come conscious of the importance of controlling the economy of our community. If we own the stores, if we operate the businesses, if we try and establish some industry in our own community, then we're developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind. Once you gain control of the economy of your own community, then you don't have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business.

The social philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to get together and remove the evils, the vices, alcoholism, drug addiction, and other evils that are destroying the moral fiber of our community. We our selves have to lift the level of our community, the standard of our community to a higher level, make our own society beautiful so that we will be satisfied in our own social circles and won't be running around here trying to knock our way into a social circle where we're not wanted. So I say, in spreading a gospel such as black nationalism, it is not designed to make the black man re-evaluate the white man -- you know him already -- but to make the black man re-evaluate himself. Don't change the white man's mind -- you can't change his mind, and that whole thing about appealing to the moral conscience of America -- America's conscience is bankrupt. She lost all conscience a long time ago. Uncle Sam has no conscience.

They don't know what morals are. They don't try and eliminate an evil because it's evil, or because it's illegal, or because it's immoral; they eliminate it only when it threatens their existence. So you're wasting your time appealing to the moral conscience of a bankrupt man like Uncle Sam. If he had a conscience, he'd straighten this thing out with no more pressure being put upon him. So it is not necessary to change the white man's mind. We have to change our own mind. You can't change his mind about us. We've got to change our own minds about each other. We have to see each other with new eyes. We have to see each other as brothers and sisters. We have to come together with warmth so we can develop unity and harmony that's necessary to get this problem solved ourselves. How can we do this? How can we avoid jealousy? How can we avoid the suspicion and the divisions that exist in the community? I'll tell you how.

I have watched how Billy Graham comes into a city, spreading what he calls the gospel of Christ, which is only white nationalism. That's what he is. Billy Graham is a white nationalist; I'm a black nationalist. But since it's the natural tendency for leaders to be jealous and look upon a powerful figure like Graham with suspicion and envy, how is it possible for him to come into a city and get all the cooperation of the church leaders? Don't think because they're church leaders that they don't have weaknesses that make them envious and jealous -- no, everybody's got it. It's not an accident that when they want to choose a cardinal, as Pope I over there in Rome, they get in a closet so you can't hear them cussing and fighting and carrying on.

Billy Graham comes in preaching the gospel of Christ. He evangelizes the gospel. He stirs everybody up, but he never tries to start a church. If he came in trying to start a church, all the churches would be against him. So, he just comes in talking about Christ and tells everybody who gets Christ to go to any church where Christ is; and in this way the church cooperates with him. So we're going to take a page from his book.

Our gospel is black nationalism. We're not trying to threaten the existence of any organization, but we're spreading the gospel of black nationalism. Anywhere there's a church that is also preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join that church. If the NAACP is preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join the NAACP. If CORE is spreading and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join CORE. Join any organization that has a gospel that's for the uplift of the black man. And when you get into it and see them pussyfooting or compromising, pull out of it because that's not black nationalism. We'll find another one.

And in this manner, the organizations will increase in number and in quantity and in quality, and by August, it is then our intention to have a black nationalist convention which will consist of delegates from all over the country who are interested in the political, economic and social philosophy of black nationalism. After these delegates convene, we will hold a seminar; we will hold discussions; we will listen to everyone. We want to hear new ideas and new solutions and new answers. And at that time, if we see fit then to form a black nationalist party, we'll form a black nationalist party. If it's necessary to form a black nationalist army, we'll form a black nationalist army. It'll be the ballot or the bullet. It'll be liberty or it'll be death.

It's time for you and me to stop sitting in this country, letting some cracker senators, Northern crackers and Southern crackers, sit there in Washington, D.C., and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and I are supposed to have civil rights. There's no white man going to tell me anything about my rights. Brothers and sisters, always remember, if it doesn't take senators and congressmen and presidential proclamations to give freedom to the white man, it is not necessary for legislation or proclamation or Supreme Court decisions to give freedom to the black man. You let that white man know, if this is a country of freedom, let it be a country of freedom; and if it's not a country of freedom, change it.

We will work with anybody, anywhere, at any time, who is genuinely interested in tackling the problem head-on, nonviolently as long as the enemy is nonviolent, but violent when the enemy gets violent. We'll work with you on the voter-registration drive, we'll work with you on rent strikes, we'll work with you on school boycotts; I don't believe in any kind of integration; I'm not even worried about it, because I know you're not going to get it anyway; you're not going to get it because you're afraid to die; you've got to be ready to die if you try and force yourself on the white man, because he'll get just as violent as those crackers in Mississippi, right here in Cleveland. But we will still work with you on the school boycotts be cause we're against a segregated school system. A segregated school system produces children who, when they graduate, graduate with crippled minds. But this does not mean that a school is segregated because it's all black. A segregated school means a school that is controlled by people who have no real interest in it whatsoever.

Let me explain what I mean. A segregated district or community is a community in which people live, but outsiders control the politics and the economy of that community. They never refer to the white section as a segregated community. It's the all-Negro section that's a segregated community. Why? The white man controls his own school, his own bank, his own economy, his own politics, his own everything, his own community; but he also controls yours. When you're under someone else's control, you're segregated. They'll always give you the lowest or the worst that there is to offer, but it doesn't mean you're segregated just because you have your own. You've got to control your own. Just like the white man has control of his, you need to control yours.

You know the best way to get rid of segregation? The white man is more afraid of separation than he is of integration. Segregation means that he puts you away from him, but not far enough for you to be out of his jurisdiction; separation means you're gone. And the white man will integrate faster than he'll let you separate. So we will work with you against the segregated school system because it's criminal, because it is absolutely destructive, in every way imaginable, to the minds of the children who have to be exposed to that type of crippling education.

Last but not least, I must say this concerning the great controversy over rifles and shotguns. The only thing that I've ever said is that in areas where the government has proven itself either unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of Negroes, it's time for Negroes to defend themselves. Article number two of the constitutional amendments provides you and me the right to own a rifle or a shotgun. It is constitutionally legal to own a shotgun or a rifle. This doesn't mean you're going to get a rifle and form battalions and go out looking for white folks, although you'd be within your rights -- I mean, you'd be justified; but that would be illegal and we don't do anything illegal. If the white man doesn't want the black man buying rifles and shotguns, then let the government do its job.

That's all. And don't let the white man come to you and ask you what you think about what Malcolm says -- why, you old Uncle Tom. He would never ask you if he thought you were going to say, "Amen!" No, he is making a Tom out of you." So, this doesn't mean forming rifle clubs and going out looking for people, but it is time, in 1964, if you are a man, to let that man know. If he's not going to do his job in running the government and providing you and me with the protection that our taxes are supposed to be for, since he spends all those billions for his defense budget, he certainly can't begrudge you and me spending $12 or $15 for a single-shot, or double-action. I hope you understand. Don't go out shooting people, but any time -- brothers and sisters, and especially the men in this audience; some of you wearing Congressional Medals of Honor, with shoulders this wide, chests this big, muscles that big -- any time you and I sit around and read where they bomb a church and murder in cold blood, not some grownups, but four little girls while they were praying to the same God the white man taught them to pray to, and you and I see the government go down and can't find who did it.

Why, this man -- he can find Eichmann hiding down in Argentina somewhere. Let two or three American soldiers, who are minding somebody else's business way over in South Vietnam, get killed, and he'll send battleships, sticking his nose in their business. He wanted to send troops down to Cuba and make them have what he calls free elections -- this old cracker who doesn't have free elections in his own country.

No, if you never see me another time in your life, if I die in the morning, I'll die saying one thing: the ballot or the bullet, the ballot or the bullet.

If a Negro in 1964 has to sit around and wait for some cracker senator to filibuster when it comes to the rights of black people, why, you and I should hang our heads in shame. You talk about a march on Washington in 1963, you haven't seen anything. There's some more going down in '64.

And this time they're not going like they went last year. They're not going singing ''We Shall Overcome." They're not going with white friends. They're not going with placards already painted for them. They're not going with round-trip tickets. They're going with one way tickets. And if they don't want that non-nonviolent army going down there, tell them to bring the filibuster to a halt.

The black nationalists aren't going to wait. Lyndon B. Johnson is the head of the Democratic Party. If he's for civil rights, let him go into the Senate next week and declare himself. Let him go in there right now and declare himself. Let him go in there and denounce the Southern branch of his party. Let him go in there right now and take a moral stand -- right now, not later. Tell him, don't wait until election time. If he waits too long, brothers and sisters, he will be responsible for letting a condition develop in this country which will create a climate that will bring seeds up out of the ground with vegetation on the end of them looking like something these people never dreamed of. In 1964, it's the ballot or the bullet.

We sit next to each other in the car
But there is no music
I always held your left hand
But now you’re picking at your lips

I know what you're going to say, please don't say it
Don't know why Don't know why
I want to draw out each minute, each second
But the empty road rushes me on

After going round and round
I arrive at your house that's so familiar and tears fall
After spending a long day finding this place
I feel like I am lost

Please don't, please don't leave
Don’t know why Don’t know why
It's not even raining but outside the window
You grow white and farther apart

Letting you go
Is not as easy as it sounds
I turn away, not being able to see you leave me
Tears eventually drop and I need to wipe them away now
I don’t know whether I should use
The handkerchief you gave me or throw it away
Why won't this trembling go away?
I pretend to be crazy and hold onto you but
My body won't listen to me
Intoxicated with the scent of you in the car
I don't want to wake up forever

Please don’t (please) don't leave please (please)

[Chorus]
멀어져만 가는 그대, you're the only one
내가 사랑했던 것만큼, you're the only one
아프고 아프지만 바보 같지만 goodbye
다시 널 못 본다 해도, you're the only one, only one

[Verse 1]
어색하게 마주앉아
사소한 얘기로 안부를 묻고
가끔 대화가 끊기는 순간에는
차가운 정적 우릴 얼게 만들어 (만들어)
[Pre-Chorus]
지금 이 자리에서 우리는 남이 되겠지
어느 누군가는 눈물 흘리며 남겠지만
상처주지 않으려고 자꾸 애를 써가면서
눈치 보는 니 모습 싫어, so I'll let you go, oh

[Chorus]
내사랑 이제는 안녕, you're the only one (You're the only one)
이별하는 이순간에도, you're the only one
아프고 아프지만 바보 같지만 goodbye (Oh, oh)
다시 널 못 본다 해도, you're the only one, only one

[Interlude]
You're the only one (Only one)

[Verse 2]
갑작스런 나의 말에
왠지 모르게 넌 안심한듯해
어디서부터 우린 이렇게 잘못된 걸까?
오래 전부터 다른 곳만 기대한 건 아닌지, whoa (Whoa)

[Pre-Chorus]
너무 다른 시작과 끝의 그 날카로움이 (Ah)
내 심장을 찌르는 아픔은 왜 똑같은지
벅찬 가슴이 한 순간에 공허하게 무너져서 (Ah, whoa)
이런 내 모습 어떻게 일어설까

다시 널 못 본다 해도, you're the only one (You're the only one)

[Post-Chorus]
내 머릿속은 언제쯤 너를 지울까 (I will let you go)
하루 이틀 한달, 멀게는 아마 몇 년쯤 (My baby, can't forget)
그리고 언젠가 너의 기억 속에는 (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
나란 사람은 더 이상 살지 않겠지 지우겠지

Someone's gone out fishing, someone's high and dry
Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
And I'm left stranded, wondering why

[Verse 2]
You and me together, nothing feels so good
Even if I get a medal from my local neighbourhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles
And I'm still stranded, wondering why
[Chorus]
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold

[Verse 3]
Some boat's on the ocean, we're here in this room
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon
We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky
No more wondering, wondering why

[Bridge]
Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump in the dead of the night
So let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

[Chorus]
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
Such a beautiful night for love

숨겨도 twinkle 어쩌나
눈에 확 띄잖아
베일에 싸여 있어도
나는 twinkle 티가 나

딴 사람들도 다
빛나는 나를 좋아해
끝까지 경계해야 해
보석을 훔친 너잖아
늘 나의 곁을 지켜줘
내 주위만 맴돌아
눈을 떼지 말아줘
내 매력에 빠져

숨겨도 twinkle 어쩌나
눈에 확 띄잖아
베일에 싸여 있어도
나는 twinkle 티가 나

난 미지의 세계
시간을 잊어버릴걸
아침에 눈을 떠봐도
꿈은 계속될 거야

난 너를 위해 꾸미고
더 예쁘게 날 반짝일래
왜 너만 혼자 몰라
나의 진가를

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.

THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.


THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!

THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.

(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

CISSY CAFFREY



I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)

THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.

CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.

(She sings.)
I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.

PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!

CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)

She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.


(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.
STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.

(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)

LYNCH So that?

STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!

STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

LYNCH Ba!

STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.

LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)

BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)

BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)

THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?

THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.

BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)

BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)

BLOOM O!

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.

(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.

BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.

RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?

BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.

RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.

RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!

BLOOM Mamma!

ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!

BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

BLOOM Molly!

MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)

MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...

MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.

BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

THE SOAP

We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.


(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

SWENY Three and a penny, please.

BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

MARION (Softly.) Poldy!

BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)

BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)

BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.

BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.

(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

MRS BREEN Mr.

BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!

BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.


(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.

BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.

MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.

MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.

BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.

(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

RICHIE Best value in Dub.

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.

RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!

BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.

MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.

BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?

MRS BREEN Let's.

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

THE BAWD Jewman's melt!

BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.

BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.

BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .

MRS BREEN Too.

BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .

MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!

PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.

THE NAVVY (Shouts.)

We are the boys. Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.

THENAVVY (Shouts.)

The galling chain.
And free our native land.


(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.

(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)

Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.

BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.

(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)

THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.

(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)

FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.

BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)

THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.

BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)

SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.

BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.

FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.

FIRST WATCH Proof.

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)

BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.

FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.

SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.

BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.

MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.

FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.

BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.

SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

FIRST WATCH Regiment.

BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?

BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.

FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.

BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.

BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.


BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.

BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.

BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.

FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.

BLOOM She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!

(General laughter.)

GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.

BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)

Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...


(He is howled down.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

BLOOM A penny in the pound.

(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.

(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.

MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.

BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.

MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!

BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.

BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?

BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.

(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.

(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)

THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)

Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo


(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.

(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)

THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.

THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?

THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.

THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.

FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.

SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.

THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)

THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)

LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?

(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.

(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .

HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.

SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?

PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!

BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.

SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?

FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.

PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.

A VOICE O rocks.

PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.

(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.

PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.

(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!

JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.

(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)

BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?

BLOOM Not I!

ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)

ZOE How's the nuts?

BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.

ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.

BLOOM Not likely.

ZOE I feel it.

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)

BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)

ZOE You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.

BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.

ZOE And you know what thought did?

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?

ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!

BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

BLOOM'S BOYS

The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.


A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.

A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!

(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)

A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?

A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!

A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!

A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.

(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)

THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

ALL God save Leopold the First!

BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.

WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.

MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!

(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.

(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)

JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!

BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!

JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.

A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!

AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.

AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.

BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)

(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)

THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)

THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.


(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)


BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.


BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!


THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!


(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)


BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.


(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)


JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.


PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?


BLOOM Pay them, my friend.


PADDY LEONARD Thank you.


NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?


BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.


J.J. O'MOLLY A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O'Brien!


NOSEY FLYNN Where do I draw the five pounds?

CHRIS CALLINAN What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of Aldebaran?

BLOOM Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.

JOE HYNES Why aren't you in uniform?

BLOOM When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?

BEN DOLLARD Pansies?

BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.

BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?

BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.

LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.

CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.

BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.

ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?

BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.

O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.

DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!

BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?

(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)

FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.

MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!

MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!

NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.

BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)

I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.


HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.

PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!

BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)

LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!

THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.

BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.

THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.

THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)

(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.

MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?

BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.

BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.

BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

A FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?

A HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?

BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!

(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)

THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!


THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

If you see kay
Tell him he may

HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)

MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!

(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)

MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.

BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!

(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)

REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.

THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!

BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)

THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!

BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.

(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)

ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.

BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.

ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.

BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.

ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?

ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?

BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.

ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.

BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.

ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.

BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE Babby!

BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.

ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)

THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)

ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.

BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.

ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!

ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?

LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!

ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?

THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!

STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

THE CAP Bah!

STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)

STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!

LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)

FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY No!

ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!

FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)

STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

ALL What?

THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)

FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)

THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)

ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...

THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!

ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.

ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.

STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.

(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)

THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.

ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

LYNCH I'm not looking.

ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)

VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

BLOOM She is rather lean.

VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.

VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.

VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

BLOOM With?...

VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.

BLOOM The stye I dislike.

VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.

(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.

BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?

VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...

VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.

VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.

I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!


(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.

FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.

STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?

FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)

PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?

(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?

FLORRY And the song?

STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.

STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.

ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.

VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!

LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM Poor man!

ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.

BLOOM How?

VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.

KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?

PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.

(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)

LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.

ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.

LYNCH Three wise virgins.

VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.

(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!

A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.

HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.

VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

HENRY All is lost now.

(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.

LYNCH All one and the same God to her.

STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.

STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.

(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

THE CARDINAL

Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.


(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

(The trick doorhandle turns.)

THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

ZOE The devil is in that door.

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)

ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?

ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)

BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.

ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)

THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.

BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.

BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.

THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?

BLOOM Yes. No.

THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.

THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.

BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.

THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.

BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?

THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!

BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!

BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!

BELLO Dungdevourer!

BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.

BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!

BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.

BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.

BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.

FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.

KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.

BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

BELLO (Twisting.) Another!

BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!

BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)

BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)

BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.

ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.

BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.

BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?

BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !

BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.

BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)

BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

A BIDDER A florin!

(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

A VOICE One and eightpence too much.

THE LACQUEY Barang!

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?

BLOOM Eccles Street.

BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!

BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.

BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.

BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...

BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)

SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!

BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.

BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!

BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.

BLOOM They... I

BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...

A VOICE Swear!

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?

(He bites his thumb.)

BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!

BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)

BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)

THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.

VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)

THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.

THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.

THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?

THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.

BLOOM You understood them?

THE YEWS Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!

BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.

(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)

THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!

(They cheer.)

BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO Fool!

THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?

THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.


THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!

BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!

BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)

THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...

BLOOM Done. Prff.

THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?

BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.

BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!

THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.

THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!

BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.

THE WATERFALL

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!

THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)

THE BUTTON Bip!

(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

THE SLUTS

O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.


BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!

THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!

BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !

BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)

BELLA You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.

BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!

BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?

ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)

BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

ZOE

Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.


BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.

STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.

BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.

STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.

BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)

BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!

KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)

FLORRY And me?

LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.

BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.

BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.

ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)

BLOOM This is yours.

STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.

BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.

STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?

STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.

BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM No, but...

STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?

ZOE Is he hungry?

STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)

Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.


ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.

LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)

LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.

(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)

FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.

(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.

ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.

STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE What day were you born?

STEPHEN Thursday. Today.

ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.

FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.

ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?

BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.

BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.

ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.

BLOOM Wrong.

ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?

(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.

(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.

ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?

(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

FLORRY What?

(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)

THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?

(Bronze by gold they whisper.)

ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.

(They whisper again.)

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)

LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.

LENEHAN A good night's work.

BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.

LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!

ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.

BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?

BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?

BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.

MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!

BELLA What? What is it?

(Zoe whispers to her.)

MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.

BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.

BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...

KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!

LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.

BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!

BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!

LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!

BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?

ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.

BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM

(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!

STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.

BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.

LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.

ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous. Misters very selects for is pleasure must to visit heaven and hell show with mortuary candles and they tears silver which occur every night. Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!

LYNCH Vive le vampire!

THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!

STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.

BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...

STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)

BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...

THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!

STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.

ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.

LYNCH Across the world for a wife.

FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.

STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?

BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.

STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!

BLOOM I say, look...

STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!

(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

THE CROWD

Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!


(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!

GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!

(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)

STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!

ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY

Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...


ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?

BLOOM Who'll.

LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.

STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?

(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

HOURS You may touch my.

CAVALIERS May I touch your?

HOURS O, but lightly!

CAVALIERS O, so lightly!

THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!

(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!

ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!

MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!

(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

ZOE I'm giddy.

(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)

MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)

MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!

THE PIANOLA

Best, best of all,
Baraabum!


KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!

(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)

STEPHEN Pas seul!

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

THE PIANOLA

Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.


(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)

TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!

SIMON Think of your mother's people!

STEPHEN Dance of death.

(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)

(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)

STEPHEN Ho!

(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

THE CHOIR

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...


(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.


THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.


STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?


BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.


THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.


STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.


THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.


STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.


THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.


STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!


THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!


FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.


BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.


THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!


STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!


THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)


STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)


BLOOM (At the window.) What?


STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!


FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)


THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!


STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!


THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.


STEPHEN Nothung!


(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


THE GASJET Pwfungg!


BLOOM Stop!


LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!


BELLA Police!


(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!


(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)


THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.


ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.


BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.


BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?


A WHORE He tore his coat.


BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.


BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...


BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.


BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...


BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!


BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!


FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?


BELLA Do you want me to call the police?


BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.


BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!


BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.


BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?


ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.


BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!


(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?


STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.


CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.


STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.


VOICES She's faithfultheman.


CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.


PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.


PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.


STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.


CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.


STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...


PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?


STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?


DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.


(He staggers a pace back.)


BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.


STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.


BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.


CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.


BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?


(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.


(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.


STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.


STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.

BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.

STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)

KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

PATRICE Socialiste!

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.

STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!

A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.


THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.


RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.

(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!


PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...

(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?

STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.

CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!

A ROUGH Our men retreated.

PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!

(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)

PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.

STEPHEN Did I? When?

BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.

THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!

(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.

PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)

CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!

CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.

BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!

STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.

PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!

STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.


VOICES Police!

DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.

THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Dooooooooooog!

THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Goooooooooood!

(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)

PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!

BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?

LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)

STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.

BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.

STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.

CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.

BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.

PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.

(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!

THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!

(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)

THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.

BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!

PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!

(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)

FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?

A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.

BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.

BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?

BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

FIRST WATCH Name and address.

(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.

(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.

SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.

BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.

SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)

BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...

(The horse neighs.)

THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)

CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!

THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.

BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)

CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.

BLOOM Night.

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!

STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!

(Murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)

BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!

RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10EmbedMISSING YOU Lyrics[지드래곤 "Missing You" 가사]

[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
아무 생각 없이 평소와 같이
보통 사람들과 만나 웃고 말하지
밤이 되면 TV가 내 유일한 친구고
아침해가 떠오르면은 그제서야 잠이 들죠
너무 초라해 나 널 많이 좋아했나봐
네가 떠난 후 파란 하늘 내 눈엔 노랗게만 보여
그댄 어디서 아파해요? 나 여기 있어
아님 혹시 다른 사람과 다른 사랑하니?
보고싶어, my baby
[Chorus: 김윤아]
내 맘은 이리 울적한데 말할 사람이 없다

Maybe I'm missing you, oh-oh
Maybe I'm missing you, oh-oh
Maybe I'm missing you, oh-oh
Maybe I'm missing you

[Verse 2: G-Dragon]
그땐 그랬지. 우리 사이는 투명하고 깨끗했지
처음에는 애틋했지. 다들 그래. 알면서 왜 그랬지?
(But) 갈수록 유리 깨지듯, 손에 낀 반지가 빛 바래지듯
날카로운 칼에 베이듯, 속박이란 사슬에 목이 죄이듯
늘 좋을 줄만 알았던 너와의 기억도
풀리지 않던 오해 및 상처만 남아 싫어도
헤어져란 말은 끝까지 참았어야만 했는데
(그래도) 싸우고 다투던 그때가 지금보단 나았을텐데

[Chorus: 김윤아]
내 맘은 이리 울적한데 말할 사람이 없다
나도 가끔 활짝 웃고 싶은데 곁엔 아무도 없다

I shall crown thee, knight,   king with my handes."

Then Sir Mordred full mildly   meles himselven,           speaks
Kneeled to the conquerour   and carpes these wordes:
"I beseek you, sir,   as my sib lord,           beseech; related by blood
That ye will for charitee   chese you another,           choose
For if ye put me in this plitt,   your pople is deceived;           plight; people
To present a prince estate   my power is simple;           princely
When other of war-wisse   are worshipped hereafter,           cunning in warfare
Then may I, forsooth,   be set but at little.           be little regarded
To pass in your presence   my purpose is taken           travel
And all my perveance appert   for my pris knightes."           provisions ready

"Thou art my nevew full ner,   my nurree of old,           nephew; near; nursling
That I have chastied and chosen,   a child of my chamber;           disciplined; praised
For the sibreden of me,   forsake not this office;           blood relationship to
That thou ne work my will,   thou wot what it menes."           If; know; means

Now he takes his leve   and lenges no longer
At lordes, at lege-men   that leves him behinden;           With; leaves
And senn that worthiliche wye   went unto chamber           then; worthy man
For to comfort the queen   that in care lenges.
Waynor waikly   weepand him kisses,           weakly weeping
Talkes to him tenderly   with teres ynow;           tears

That warnes me worship   of my wedde lord;           denies; wedded
All my liking of life   out of land wendes,           pleasure
And I in langour am left,   leve ye, forever!           believe
Why ne might I, dere love,   die in your armes,
Ere I this destainy of dole   sholde drie by mine one!"           destiny; suffer; alone

"Greve thee not, Gaynor,   for Goddes love of heven,
Ne grouch not my ganging;   it shall to good turn!           begrudge; going
Thy wandrethes and thy weeping   woundes mine herte;           sorrows
I may not wite of this wo   for all this world rich;           turn aside from

Overling of Yngland,   under thyselven,           Overlord
And that is Sir Mordred,   that thou has mikel praised,           much

Then he takes his leve   at ladies in chamber,           from

And then sho swoones full swithe   when he his sword asked,           she; requested
Sways in swooning,   swelte as sho wolde!           as if she would die
He pressed to his palfrey,   in presence of lordes,           hastened

With a real rout   of the Round Table,           company
Sought toward Sandwich;   sho sees him no more.           Went; she

There the grete were gadered   with galiard knightes,           Gathered; jolly
Garnished on the green feld   and graitheliche arrayed;           drawn up suitably
Dukes and douspeeres   daintely rides,           high noblemen

Rewles before the rich   of the Round Table,           Give orders (to their men) before the powerful (men) of the Round Table
Assignes ilk a countree   to certain lordes,           the soldiers from each country

Thus they stow in the stuff   of full steren knightes.           stern

But unteld them tite,   as the tide runnes;           untied; quickly

Castes courses by craft   when the cloud rises
With the needle and the stone   on the night tides.           a compass
For drede of the dark night   they dreched a little           slowed down
And all the steren of the streme   steken at ones.           And all the stern men of the stream (i.e., sailors) struck sail at once

The king was in a grete cogge   with knightes full many,           ship
In a cabane enclosed,   clenlich arrayed;           cabin; completely
Within on a rich bed   restes a little,
And with the swogh of the se   in swefning he fell.           swaying; dreaming
Him dremed of a dragon,   dredful to behold,           He dreamed
Come drivand over the deep   to drenchen his pople,           driving; drown
Even walkand   out the West landes,           Directly walking
Wanderand unworthyly   over the wale ythes;           Wandered unbecomingly; surging waves
Both his hed and his hals   were holly all over           neck; wholly
Ounded of azure,   enamelled full fair;           Covered with waves of azure, enamelled (coloured) very fair
His shoulders were shaled   all in clene silver           His shoulders were all covered with scales of pure silver
Shredde over all the shrimp   with shrinkand pointes;           That clothed the monster with shrinking points (like mail)
His womb and his winges   of wonderful hewes,           belly; hues
In marvelous mailes   he mounted full high.
Whom that he touched   he was tint forever!           lost
His feet were flourished   all in fine sable           decorated
And such a venomous flaire   flow from his lippes           flame flowed
The flood of the flawes   all on fire seemed!           outpouring; flames

Then come out of the Orient,   even him againes,           Then came out of the East, directly against him
A black bustous bere   aboven in the cloudes,           A wild black bear above in the clouds
With ech a paw as a post   and paumes full huge           With each paw as big as a post, and palms very huge
With pikes full perilous,   all pliand them seemed;           With very perilous claws that seemed all curling
Lothen and lothly,   lockes and other,           Hateful and loathly, his hair and the rest
All with lutterd legges,   lokkerd unfair,           With legs all bowed, covered with ugly hair
Filtered unfreely,   with fomand lippes -            That was churlishly matted, with foaming lips
The foulest of figure   that formed was ever!
He baltered, he blered,   he braundished thereafter;           danced about; grimaced
To batail he bounes him   with bustous clawes;           prepares himself; wild
He romed, he rored,   that rogged all the erthe,           bellowed; roared; rocked
So rudely he rapped at   to riot himselven!           So violently he stamped on (the earth) to enjoy himself

Then the dragon on dregh   dressed him againes           finally came against him
And with his duttes him drove   on dregh by the welken;           blows; afar; sky
He fares as a faucon,   frekly he strikes;           falcon; boldly
Both with feet and with fire   he fightes at ones.
The bere in the batail   the bigger him seemed,           bear
And bites him boldly   with baleful tuskes;
Such buffetes he him reches   with his brode klokes,           gives; claws
His breste and his brayell   was bloody all over.           breast; waist
He ramped so rudely   that all the erthe rives,           He reared up on his hind legs so rudely that all the earth was shaken
Runnand on red blood   as rain of the heven!           Running
He had weried the worm   by wightness of strenghe           wearied; serpent; stoutness
Ne were it not for the wild fire   that he him with defendes.           himself

Then wanders the worm   away to his heightes,           serpent
Comes glidand fro the cloudes   and coupes full even,           strikes directly
Touches him with his talones   and teres his rigge,           tears; back
Betwix the taile and the top   ten foot large!           long
Thus he brittened the bere   and brought him o live,           Thus he beat down the bear and killed him
Let him fall in the flood,   fleet where him likes.           float
So they thring the bold king   binne the ship-borde,           These dreams so oppress the king aboard the ship
That ner he bristes for bale   on bed where he ligges.           That he nearly bursts for pain on the bed where he lies

Then waknes the wise king,   wery fortravailed,           wakens; wearily exhausted
Takes him two philosophers   that followed him ever,
In the seven science   the sutelest founden,           most subtle
The cunningest of clergy   under Crist knowen;           most learned of scholars
He told them of his torment   that time that he sleeped:
"Dreched with a dragon   and such a derf beste,           Harassed; dire beast
Has made me full wery,   as wisse me Our Lord;           guide
Ere I mon swelt as swithe,   ye tell me my swefen!"           Before I must die quickly, interpret my dream for me

"Sir," said they soon then,   these sage philosophers,           immediately; wise
"The dragon that thou dremed of,   so dredful to shew,           dreamed; behold
That come drivand over the deep   to drenchen thy pople,           driving; drown
Soothly and certain   thyselven it is,
That thus sailes over the se   with thy seker knightes.           trusty
The coloures that were casten   upon his clere winges           shining
May be thy kingrikes all,   that thou has right wonnen,           kingdoms
And the tattered tail,   with tonges so huge,           tongues
Betokens this fair folk   that in thy fleet wendes.           Signifies
The bere that brittened was   aboven in the cloudes           beaten down
Betokenes the tyrauntes   that tormentes thy pople
Or elles with some giaunt   some journee shall happen,           else; day's fight
In singular batail   by yourselve one;           battle; alone
And thou shall have the victory,   through help of Our Lord,
As thou in thy vision   was openly shewed.
Of this dredful dreme   ne drede thee no more,           dream
Ne care not, sir conquerour,   but comfort thyselven
And these that sailes over the se   with thy seker knightes."

With trumpes then tristly   they trussen up their sailes           trumpet calls; boldly
And rowes over the rich se,   this rout all at ones;           company
The comly coste of Normandy   they catchen full even           coast; reach
And blithely at Barflete   these bold are arrived,           Barfleur
And findes a fleet there   of frendes ynow,
The flowr and the fair folk   of fifteen rewmes,           kingdoms
For kinges and capitaines   keeped him fair,           awaited
As he at Carlisle commaunded   at Cristenmass himselven.

By they had taken the land   and tentes up rered,           By the time; reared
Comes a Templar tite   and touched to the king;           quickly; told
"Here is a tyraunt beside   that tormentes thy pople,
A grete giaunt of Gene,   engendered of fendes;           Genoa; by fiends
He has freten of folk   mo than five hundreth,           devoured; more; hundred
And als fele fauntekins   of free-born childer.           And as many infants of noble children
This has been his sustenaunce   all this seven winteres,
And yet is that sot not sad,   so well him it likes!           rogue
In the countree of Constantine   no kind has he leved           family; left
Withouten kidd casteles,   enclosed with walles,
That he ne has clenly distroyed   all the knave childer,           male children
And them carried to the crag   and clenly devoured.
The duchess of Bretain   today has he taken,           Brittany
Beside Reines as sho rode   with her rich knightes,           Rennes; she
Led her to the mountain   there that lede lenges           man
To lie by that lady   ay whiles her life lastes.
We followed o ferrome   mo than five hundreth           from afar
Of bernes and of burges   and bachelers noble,           townsmen
But he covered the crag;   sho cried so loud           got to
The care of that creature   cover shall I never           recover
Sho was the flowr of all Fraunce   or of five rewmes,
And one of the fairest   that formed was ever,
The gentilest jowell   ajudged with lordes           most noble jewel; by
Fro Gene unto Gerone   by Jesu of heven!           Genoa; Gironne
Sho was thy wifes cosin,   know it if thee likes,           relative; acknowledge
Comen of the richest   that regnes in erthe;           reigns
As thou art rightwise king,   rew on thy pople           righteous; have pity
And fonde for to venge them   that thus are rebuked!"           endeavour; avenge

"Alas," says Sir Arthur,   "so long have I lived!
Had I witten of this,   well had me cheved.           known; achieved
Me is not fallen fair   but me is foul happened
That thus this fair lady   this fend has destroyed!           fiend
I had lever than all Fraunce   this fifteen winter           I would give the revenues of all France for the past fifteen years
I had been before that freke   a furlong of way           To have been even a furlong from that man
When he that lady had laght   and led to the mountes;           seized
I had left my life   ere sho had harm limped.           suffered
But wolde thou ken me to that crag   there that keen lenges,           show; keen one
I wolde kaire to that coste   and carp with himselven,
To trete with that tyraunt   for tresoun of landes           treat; treason
And take trews for a time   til it may tide better."           truce; betide

"Sir, see ye yon forland   with yon two fires?           promontary
There filsnes that fend,   fraist when thee likes,           lurks; try
Upon the crest of the crag   by a cold well
That encloses the cliff   with the clere strandes;           shining
There may thou find folk   fey withouten number,           dead
Mo florines, in faith,   than Fraunce is in after,           More coins
And more tresure untrewly   that traitour has getten           dishonestly; gotten
Than in Troy was, as I trow,   that time that it was wonnen."           believe

Then romes the rich king   for rewth of the pople,           bellows; pity
Raikes right to a tent   and restes no lenger;           Goes; longer
He welteres, he wresteles,   he wringes his handes;           writhes; wrestles
There was no wye of this world   that wiste what he mened.           knew; meant
He calles Sir Kayous   that of the cup served
And Sir Bedvere the bold   that bore his brand rich:           sword
"Look ye after even-song   be armed at rightes           completely
On blonkes by yon buscaile,   by yon blithe stremes,           horses; brush; calm
For I will pass in pilgrimage   privily hereafter,
In the time of souper,   when lordes are served,           dinner
For to seeken a saint   by yon salt stremes,
In Saint Michel mount,   there miracles are shewed."

After even-song   Sir Arthur himselven
Went to his wardrope   and warp off his weedes           wardrobe; threw; clothes
Armed him in a aketoun   with orfrayes full rich;           padded jacket; gold trim
Aboven, on that, a jerin   of Acres out over;           Upon that, a leather jacket
Aboven that a gesseraunt   of gentle mailes,           coat of mail
A jupon of Jerodine   jagged in shredes;           gipon; shreds
He braides on a bacenett   burnisht of silver           draws; helmet
The best that was in Basel,   with bordours rich;           borders
The crest and the coronal   enclosed so fair           diadem
With claspes of clere gold,   couched with stones;           shining; set
The vesar, the aventail, enarmed so fair,           visor; face-guard; plated
Void withouten vice,   with windowes of silver;           Devoid of defects
His gloves gaylich gilt   and graven at the hemmes           gaily; decorated
With graines and gobelets,   glorious of hew.           seed pearls; jewels
He braces a brode sheld   and his brand askes,           He puts on the arm straps (braces) of a broad shield and asks for his sword
Bouned him a brown steed   and on the bente hoves;           Went to; ground waits
He stert til his stirrup   and strides on loft,           leapt; aloft
Straines him stoutly   and stirres him fair,
Broches the bay steed   and to the busk rides,           Spurs; bush
And there his knightes him keeped   full clenlich arrayed.           waited

Then they rode by that river   that runned so swithe,           swiftly
There the rindes over-reches   with real boughes;           trees reach over; stately
The roe and the reindeer   reckless there runnen,           roe deer
In ranes and in rosers   to riot themselven;           bushes; rosebushes; amuse
The frithes were flourisht   with flowres full many,           woods; flowered
With faucons and fesauntes   of ferlich hewes;           falcons; pheasants; wondrous
All the fowles there flashes   that flies with winges,
For there galed the gouk   on greves full loud;           sang; cuckoo; groves
With alkine gladship   they gladden themselven;           all sorts of gladness
Of the nightingale notes   the noises was sweet;
They threped with the throstels   three hundreth at ones!           debated; thrushes
That whate swowing of water   and singing of birds,           swift sound
It might salve him of sore   that sound was never!

Then ferkes this folk   and on foot lightes,           goes
Fastenes their fair steedes   o ferrom between;           They tie their horses with a good distance between them
And then the king keenly   commaunded his knightes
For to bide with their blonkes   and boun no further;           horses; go
"For I will seek this saint   by myselve one
And mele with this master man   that this mount yemes,           speak; possesses
And senn shall ye offer,   either after other           And afterwards you shall make your offerings, each after the other
Menskfully at Saint Michel,   full mighty with Crist."           Honourably to

The king covers the crag   with cloughes full high,           gets to; ravines
To the crest of the cliff   he climbes on loft,
Cast up his umbrere   and keenly he lookes,           visor
Caught of the cold wind   to comfort himselven.
Two fires he findes   flamand full high;
The fourtedele a furlong   between them he walkes;           quarter to
The way by the well-strandes   he wanderd him one           welling water
To wite of the warlaw,   where that he lenges.           learn; warlock; dwells
He ferkes to the first fire   and even there he findes           goes
A wery woful widow   wringand her handes,
And gretand on a grave   grisly teres,           weeping
New merked on molde,   senn mid-day it seemed.           Newly dug in the earth
He salued that sorrowful   with sittand wordes           saluted; fitting
And fraines after the fend   fairly thereafter.           asks; fiend

Then this woful wife   unwinly him greetes,           woman unhappily
Coverd up on her knees   and clapped her handes,
Said: "Careful, careman,   thou carpes too loud!           man
May yon warlaw wite,   he warrays us all!           warlock know; attacks
Weryd worth the wight ay   that thee thy wit reved,           Cursed be; man; stole
That mas thee to waife here   in these wild lakes!           makes; wander
I warn thee, for worship,   thou wilnes after sorrow!           desire
Whider buskes thou, berne?   unblessed thou seemes!           Whither go
Weenes thou to britten him   with thy brand rich?           Expect; destroy; sword
Were thou wighter than Wade   or Wawain   either,           fiercer
Thou winnes no worship,   I warn thee before.
Thou sained thee unsekerly   to seek to these mountes;           You crossed yourself unsafely (started out wrong) to go to these mountains
Such six were too simple   to semble with him one,           Six such as you would be too weak to attack him alone
For, and thou see him with sight,   thee serves no herte           For, if you see him with your eyes, you will not have the heart
To saine thee sekerly,   so seemes him huge.           To cross yourself securely, so huge does he seem
Thou art freely and fair   and in thy first flowres,           noble
But thou art fey, by my faith,   and that me forthinkes!           fated to die; grieves
Were such fifty on a feld   or on a fair erthe,           fifty such (as you)
The freke wolde with his fist   fell you at ones.           man
Lo! Here the duchess dere - today was sho taken -           dear
Deep dolven and dede,   diked in moldes.           buried; buried; ground
He had murthered this mild   by mid-day were rungen,           He had murdered this mild one by the time the midday bell was rung

He has forced her and filed   and sho is fey leved;           raped; defiled; left dead
He slew her unslely   and slit her to the navel.           crudely
And here have I baumed her   and buried thereafter.           embalmed
For bale of the bootless,   blithe be I never!           sorrow; helpless
Of all the frendes sho had   there followed none after
But I, her foster moder,   of fifteen winter.           mother
To ferk off this forland   fonde shall I never,           go; promontary; endeavour
But here be founden on feld   til I be fey leved."EmbedTranslationsRomanizationSEXY LOVE Lyrics그대로 멈춰요 sexy love

Cut up cut up in the dish

I start on it, there will be no stop
You can't beat me boy, I'm SUPERMAN
(chorus)x2

I rap too the fans, makin' that cash
Cutti'n up like a piece of glass

If you can rap like Kilo man
Flllll-bass, flllll-low

So dont give me no hastle
For I'm the king of the castle
And a reign supreme
You who am I?......Kilo the dream
That's right ha ha

Some times a brother trip
I know you admire me
I didn't mean to dis you I'm sorry
I apologize, but you better recognize
What is crap if you dont know crap
What is rap if you really can't rap then
Who in the hell said they wanted a little more
What in the fuck do you take me for?
I'll never go out for the die
And you you'll never take me alive
Can Kilo keep the party jumpin?.....ha ha

And then she started sayin, oh  I,  love your ding a ling
Told the rest of the girls I was little
But I can go 24 in the middle

Stands the form burnt out of clay.
This must be the bell’s great birth!
Fellows, lend a hand to-day.
Sweat must trickle now
From the burning brow,
Till the work its master honour.
Blessing comes from Heaven’s Donor.
While we our serious work are doing,
We ought to speak a serious word,
More easily our work pursuing,
When noble speech the while is heard.
Now let us earnestly be spying
What our weak powers can create;
I scorn the man who is not trying
On his own work to meditate.
This is the fairest of man’s graces:
The power to think and understand—
For in his inmost heart he traces
What he has fashioned with his hand.
Wood that from the pine-tree came
Keep right dry with zealous care,
That the deftly governed flame
Through the furnace hole may flare.
Boiling copper’s thick—
Get the tin now, quick!
Let the substance, liquid growing,
In a docile way be flowing.
What with the help of fire’s great power.
In this deep pit our hands have framed,
High on the belfry of the tower
In mighty tones shall be proclaimed.
In ages far beyond the morrow,
A voice for many shall ring out,
And it will mourn with those in sorrow
And join the choir of the devout.
What fate, forever changing, fleeting,
To mortals far below may bring,
Against the crown of metal beating,
As music of the bell will ring.
Bubbles leaping, white and spry!
Good! The masses flow at last.
Mix them with the alkali,
That they be more quickly cast.
From all foam quite free
Shall the mixture be,
From the metal pure before us,
Rise a perfect voice sonorous.
The bell with festive peal and cheering
Greets the belovèd tender child,
Upon his life’s first way appearing,
Still in the arms of sleep beguiled.
Deep in the womb of time there stay
His destinies, both dark and gay.
His mother’s gentle, loving care
Is watching still his morning fair.
The years fly swiftly—all is play.
Away from girls, impatient, tearing,
The boy starts wildly forth to roam,
He sees the world, and, after faring,
Comes back, a stranger, to his home.
In beauty and youth’s splendour glowing,
A vision from some heavenly height,
While blushes on her cheeks are growing,
He sees the maiden with delight.
And now a strange and nameless yearning
Has seized upon the young man’s heart,
From sports and wild companions turning,
With tearful eyes he roams apart.
And happy at her slightest speaking,
Her footsteps blushingly to trace,
He wanders over meadows, seeking
The fairest flowers his love to grace.
Oh, tender longing, sweetest hoping,
First love’s enchanting, golden days!
The eye can see the heavens oping,
A bliss the heart unhindered sways.
Would it might bloom eternally—
The time of young love’s ecstasy!
See, how brown the blow-pipes grow!
When this stick has been dipped in,
And a glaze begins to show,
Then the casting should begin.
Now good fellows, quick!
Prove the mixture thick!
Hard and soft united duly
Are a lucky omen truly.
For when the stern and mild are pairing,
The tender with the strong and daring,
The tone must ring out fair and strong.
Let him who binds himself forever,
To sound his heart and hers endeavour!
Passion is short, repentance long.
On the young bride’s tresses lightly
Lies the wreath of blossoms white,
When the church bells, ringing brightly,
To the festive hour invite.
Lovely festival—the ending
Of—alas!—life’s joyous May,
Beautiful illusions rending
With the veil and bride’s array!
Passion will fly!
Love must remain;
The flower must die,
The fruit to attain.
The man must go out
To stern hostile life,
For power and strife,
To plant and to toil,
To gain and to foil,
To wager and dare,
His luck to ensnare.
And now without end the blessings are streaming,
With goodly possessions the storerooms are teeming,
The rooms are expanding, the house has to grow.
And in it there moves
The good, modest housewife,
The mother of children,
Who wise and dear
Here rules in her sphere,
And teaches the girls
And wards off the boys,
While work without end
Her busy hands tend,
Enlarging her share
Through order and care,
Her sweet-smelling linen-chests filling with treasure,
By spinning her thread in the speediest measure.
Her neatly and smoothly kept closets are full
Of linen like snow and the shining fair wool;
And still adding glamour and charm to the best,
She never can rest.
And the father with happy eye
From his mansion’s high gable is counting
Blessings fair that before him lie—
Pillars and posts as high as the trees,
Barns that are bursting with treasures that please,
Granges with bounties swelling and bending,
Grain-fields waving in billows unending.
He boasts with noble pride:
Firm as the ground abide
My homestead’s splendours bright
Against misfortune’s might!
Covenants with powers of fate
Will—alack!—not always last,
And misfortune travels fast.
Now the casting can begin,
For the dented mould is fair:
But before we pour it in,
Let us say a pious prayer!
Push the tendon hard!
God shall be our guard!
In the bell's ear smoking, glowing,
Waves of fiery brown are flowing.
Most wholesome is the force of fire,
When man can tame and guard its ire,
And from this heavenly force man takes
Good help for what he moulds and makes.
But frightful is this power's abuse
When, from its fetters broken loose,
Upon its own track wantonly
It roams as nature's daughter free.
Horror when unbound and growing
—Fiend that no resistance stays!—
Through the peopled city blowing
Sweeps along the monster-blaze!
Elements have ever hated
What the hand of man created.
From the cloud
Rain is pouring,
Earth restoring.
From the cloud, even so,
Lightnings glow!
From the tower hear the wail:
’Tis the gale!
Bloody red
Are the heavens;
Daylight ne’er such brightness shed!
Riot leavens
All the crowds!
Dense smoke-clouds!
Fiery pillar, flickering, glowing,
Down the street is swiftly going,
Like the wind so rapid growing.
Hot, as if in furnace baking,
Glows the air; the beams are breaking,
Windows rattle, posts are falling,
Mothers straying, children calling,
Beasts are moaning,
Crushed, and groaning.
All run, save and flee in fright,
Bright as daylight is the night,
Chains of eager hands are plying,
Pails are flying,
Arching water-spouts are playing,
Flames with hissing fountains spraying;
Howling wild the storm is straying,
Driving on the flame with roars.
Crackling in the dry grain-stores
Shoots the flame, through garrets sweeping,
Fast along the rafters creeping,
And, as if with monstrous blowing
It would sweep along in flight
The whole earth with all its might,
Rises, now gigantic growing,
To the sky.
Man stands by:
Hopeless, awestruck, he is yielding,
Sees the heavens their power wielding,
His own works to ruin going.
Now the homestead
Is burnt bare;
Savage storms are raging there.
Empty window-holes are staring
Horror-haunted,
And the sailing clouds undaunted
Peer inside.
Man—alack!—
Glances back
At the grave
Of the goods he could not save:
Then ventures forth with spirit brave.
However sadly he has fared,
Though raging fire has so bereft him,
The sweetest comfort still is left him:
He counts his dear ones: all are spared.
Now ’tis resting in the earth,
For the form contains its fill.
Will there be a happy birth,
To repay our care and skill?
Is there a mistake?
If the form should break?
While our hopes are soaring high—
Woe!—misfortune may be nigh.
Unto the sacred earth confiding,
We trust to her our hands’ own deed,
The sower trusts to her his seed,
Calm, with a blessèd hope abiding
That it shall grow as Heaven decreed.
Alas, we know that seed far rarer
In earth’s dark bosom buried lies,
And hope that to a lot still fairer
Out of the graveyard it will rise.
From the church
Tolls the bell
Grave and heavy
Funeral knell.
And the toll sonorous is attending
One more pilgrim on his last way wending.
Woe! It is the wife belovèd.
Woe! It is the faithful mother
Whom the shadow prince of harm
Drew from out her husband’s arm,
From her tender children’s sphere,
Whom she bare him, fair and dear,
And then watched with mother’s zest
As they grew upon her breast.
Ah! The home’s most tender ties
Are unloosed forevermore;
In the shadowland she lies
Who was mother here before.
How they miss her faithful guiding,
And the care she used to give!
In the orphaned home presiding,
Loveless strangers soon will live.
Till the bell shall cooler be,
After labour take your ease,
And as birds play in the tree,
Each shall do what he may please.
Youth, at rise of stars,
Free from duty’s bars,
Hears the evening bell, releasing:
Master’s toil is never ceasing.
In the forest wild the wanderer
Homeward turns his steps with pleasure
To his dear and cheerful cottage.
Homeward trudge the sheep-flocks bleating,
And the herds
Of the sleek and broad-browed cattle
With their lowing
To accustomed stalls are going.
Now with grain
Heavy laden,
Reels the wagon:
And beneath
Sheaves, the wreath
Fragrant lies;
To the dance the flock of reapers
Gaily flies.
Streets and markets grow more quiet;
Round the bright and genial lamplight
All the household members gather,
And the town-gate closes, creaking.
Blackness spreads
O’er the earth;
But the steady townsman dreads
Not the night
Rousing wicked men from bed:
For the eye of law is ever bright.
Sacred order, blessings spreading,
Heaven’s daughter, freely treading,
Like to like thou bindest lightly,
Cities thou hast founded rightly,
And the wild man roaming blindly
Thou hast called to home-life, kindly.
To men’s homes thy presence giving,
Thou hast taught them gentle living,
Woven of all ties the deepest—
Love for fatherland thou keepest!
Busy hands, by thousands stirring,
Briskly one another aid,
And, while eager work is spurring,
All the powers are displayed.
Under freedom’s wing united,
Master and apprentice toil,
Each with his own place delighted,
Ready any scorn to foil.
Work adorns the burgher greatly,
Blessing is our labour’s prize;
Honoured crowns make princes stately,
But in work our honour lies.
Blessed peace, oh
Sweetest concord,
Tarry, tarry
With your kindness in this town!
May that day be never dawning,
When the hordes of war with terror
Raid across this quiet valley,
When the heavens
Which the lovely glow of evening
Gently paints,
Flash, alas, when towns are burning,
Fiery taints!
Break the form now, stand me by,
For its purpose is fulfilled;
And rejoice, let heart and eye
By the well-done task be thrilled.
Swing the hammer, whack!
Till the cope shall crack!
For the finished bell shall rise,
When the form in pieces lies.
In time the master, skilled and knowing,
Can break the form most prudently.
Woe! When in fiery torrents flowing,
The ore itself seeks liberty!
In blindest rage with thundrous roaring,
The bursting house it rushes through,
As if the jaws of hell were pouring
The flames that death and horror spew.
Where raw wild forces rage and blight,
Men can create no form aright;
And no true welfare can there be,
When mobs are by themselves set free.
Woe, when the tinder-heap is swelling
In hearts of cities, in the night,	        355
The masses tear their chains, rebelling,
And free themselves with fury’s might!
Then riot, to the bell-ropes clinging,
Pulls till the bell begins to howl;
Devoted once to peaceful ringing,
She gives the sign for outrage foul.
Equality and freedom! screaming,
The burgher in once peaceful hands
Grasps weapons; streets and halls are teeming,
And everywhere swarm ruffian bands.
With jest and ribaldry unsparing,
The women like hyenas grow,
With panther’s fangs unbridled tearing
The flinching bosom of the foe.
There is no sacredness remaining,
Unloosed are ties of piety,
The bad in goodness’ place is reigning,
And every vice is swaying free.
A lion wakened is ferocious,
Destructive is the tiger’s bite;
But of all horrors most atrocious
Is man at his own madness’ height.
Woe unto those who to the yearning,
The ever-blind lend heaven’s torch!
It will not beam; to ashes burning,
The fields and cities it will scorch.
Gladness God has given me!
Now the kernel shells the mould,
Rising smoothly, evenly,
Shining like a star of gold.
Dome and crest both beam,
Like the sunlight’s gleam,
And the blazon’s quaint device
Shows performance skilled and nice.
Come in and see!
Now, fellows, let us close the ring,
For the bell’s high christening:
Concordia her name shall be.
For concord, deepest brotherhood with all,
The loving congregation she shall call.
This be the calling of the bell,
Wherefore she has been fashioned well!
With earthly life beneath her lying,
High she shall swing in heaven’s blue dome,
A neighbour of the thunder, flying
And touching on the starry home,
Her voice from heights celestial raising,
Like all the stars in heaven’s sphere,
That live and move, their Maker praising,
And leading forth the festive year.
Our bell, her metal voice devoting
Alone to grave, eternal things,
Shall ever feel, while she is floating,
The throbbing touch of time’s swift wings.
The tongue of fate, she shall be ringing:
Heartless herself and pitiless,
She shall accompany with swinging
Life’s game of constant changefulness.
And as her mighty peal sonorous
Within our ears at last shall die,
A lesson she will put before us,
That all things earthly must go by.
Come now, with the ropes’ whole might,
From her dungeon swing the bell,
Till she rise to heaven’s height,
In the realm of sound to dwell!
Pull and lift—still more!
See her move and soar!
Joy unto this city bringing,
Peace shall be her first glad ringing!EmbedTranslationsEnglishRomanization크레용 (CRAYON) Lyrics[지드래곤 "크레용" 가사]

I got sound, I got feel, I got beautiful days
I got song, I got love, I got grateful days
I got it
You makes me happy, when sky's gray
Darling, my darling
Thank you father, mother, and my friend
English translation
Turn up the radio, you can hear it today, yeah
Flowing and swaying on the wind in stereo
The rhythm makes your shoulder bounce
This emotional rhyme is gonna reach you
Right beneath the clear blue sky
We aimed for the distant future
We set off holding the master key
And kick down in the crowd one time
When I think of those fighting days
Every gratitude grants overflowing mercy
The battle that wiped out our shelter
Still rages on now and this is the front line
The unwavering pride from my father
All the work my mother put into me
And the warmth that you give me
Are tomorrow’s provisions for my survival

I got a sound. I got a feeling. I got beautiful days
I got a song. I got a love. I got grateful days
I got it
You make me happy when skies are grey
Darling, my darling
Thank you, Father, Mother, and my friend

I was born in Tokyo, raised in Hip Hop
My friends were usually those thugs
I ended up being like those thugs
I walked the back alleys of this city
Shibuya, Roppongi, yeah, my adolescence
Passed by quickly, I was deep in it
I left my backpack at high school
And caused my parents so much trouble
But time has passed, now I’m on magazine covers
The Don Dada’s influence is everywhere
When I grab the mic, I’m really No. 1
Top ranker, representing Tokyo
Yeah, this land and country give me life
And JAH1 hands me this invincible mic
I give thanks to my friends, family and fans
And continue on this unpredictable road

I got a sound. I got a feeling. I got beautiful days
I got a song. I got a love. I got grateful days
I got it
You make me happy when skies are grey
Darling, my darling
Thank you, Father, Mother, and my friend

We’re born and raised in the land of the Rising Sun
This land that we tread on like this now
Always opening up a new page
Let’s journey to each and every stage
We compose joy and thanks here
Those that understand are singing with me
We’ll say how it is without hiding anything
A reflection throwing off all pressure
Emotions pour forth and spill over
It’s a love that’ll never go out
I’ll enter the battlefield and not back away
The lily’s crest will bloom and never wither
A wind blows on this early afternoon
A rainbow sticks out after the rain like this
The puddles reflect the light of the sun
Let’s sing a hymn for our grateful days

I’ll put my heart’s beating into a song
I’ll hold everything I have here today in these hands

I got a sound. I got a feeling. I got beautiful days
I got a song. I got a love. I got grateful days
I got it
You make me happy when skies are grey
Darling, my darling
Thank you, Father, Mother, and my friendEmbedI NEED YOU LyricsLOOKING A BETTER MUSIC?

The people who produce our contents, Yoojung noona, Surin noona, Hyunji-nim, Boonhong-nim (Pink-nim?), and Nayeob-nim, it must be hard producing contents. Let's go eat pizza!!

And chief secretary Hajung-nim's family. Chief secretary Hajung-nim, Hyeosoo-nim, Seoyeon-nim, and Jiyeon-nim, of course I'm handsome, but thank you for attaching wings onto my body.

And our ARMYs, our ARMYs who I love, our ARMYs who I miss, our ARMYs who are more beautiful than anyone, our ARMYs who are more beautiful than jewelry, our ARMYs who are more beautiful than the stars in the sky, our ARMYs who are the apple of my eye, our ARMYs who are good with every good word and phrase out there.

Thank you for always liking us so much, you've had many hard times, and you've worked hard by taking our side. At each of those moments, I'm very thankful and I love you. I feel so good because I always have ARMYs. The "ARMY Effect" is probably the biggest factor in maintaining my optimistic personality. Everyone, have a happy new year and always be happy. ❤Suga

In this album that we are releasing at the start of
the New Year, I want to ask that you take care of
us this year as well.

First, my family. I miss you and want to take care
of you from beside you, but I'm sorry that I can't do
that. My family who I love, please don’t ever forget
that I love you. Thank you, always.

Our members, Namjoonie hyung. Seokjinie hyung,
Hoseokie hyung, Yoongi hyung, Taehyungie, Jeonggukie. Thinking about it, we’re already about
to enter our 5th year (since debut). I always feel this, but I think I can be strong just from looking at
you guys who are always beside me. We used to not match/mix well, but now I often think that we’re like real brothers. I want to express my gratitude to all of you who make all the work that I do feel more enjoyable. I love you.

The hyungnims who I treasure and love: Timo hyung, Sungwoon hyung, Taeminie hyung,
Kwonho hyung, Jonginie hyung. Since I see you
as often as I see my members, it might be
embarrassing to see words like this written here,
but everyday is fun because of you hyungs. Now
let the maknae buy a meal. I love you.

A.R.M.Y.

We're already approaching the start of our 5th
year (since debut). Time goes by so~ fast, doesn’t
it. I also wonder when time flew by so quickly.

Don’t worry. There’s still so much we have to show
you, so starting with this album, I think we’ll spend this year together. Let's start this album and spend
this year pleasantly. Have a happy new year. don’t
get sick, and I hope everyone can be happy. I love
you!

I love all of you who are always with us.
Sincerely, Jimin.V

Now I will write a whole letter for all the people I love

afar in a situation that couldn’t be helped after having always had me by your side, but always my family. Please watch and look after our grandfather whom we love.

I’II hold it in and work diligently to become my grandmother's grandson, a pretty grandson, so please watch over me. Have a happy new year (receive lots of fortune) and thank you for raising me all this time. I love you.

Let's go
나는 남자 없이 잘 살아
그러니 자신이 없으면
내 곁에 오지를 마
나는 함부로 날 안 팔아
왜냐면 난
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (What?)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (진짜)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (정말)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man
나는 남자 없이 잘 잘 살아
내 돈으로 방세 다 내
먹고 싶은 거 사 먹고
옷도 사 입고
충분하진 않지만 만족할 줄 알아
그래서 난 나를 사랑해, hey
부모님의 용돈 내 돈처럼
쓰고 싶지 않아 나이가 많아
손 벌리지 않는 게
당연한 거 아냐
그래서 난 내가 떳떳해, hey
Boy, don't say
내가 챙겨줄게 내가
아껴줄게, no, no
Boy, don't play
진지하게 올 게 아니면
나는 남자 없이 잘 살아
그러니 자신이 없으면
내 곁에 오지를 마
나는 함부로 날 안 팔아
왜냐면 난
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (What?)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (진짜)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (정말)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man
나는 남자 없이 잘 잘 살아
잘난 체는 안돼 딴 데서는
통할지 몰라도 너만큼 나도
잘나진 않았지만 자신감은 넘쳐
그래서 난 나를 사랑해, hey
내 힘으로 살게 딴 애처럼
부모님 잘 만나 남자 잘 만나
편하게 사는 거 관심이 없어
그래서 난 내가 떳떳해, hey
Boy, don't say
내가 너의 미래 나를
믿고 기대, no, no
Boy, don't play
나를 존중할 게 아니면
나는 남자 없이 잘 살아
그러니 자신이 없으면
내 곁에 오지를 마
나는 함부로 날 안 팔아
왜냐면 난
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (What?)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (진짜)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (정말)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man
나는 남자 없이 잘 잘 살아
매일 아침 일찍 일어나서
하루종일 바빠서
밥 한 끼 제대로 못 먹어
하지만 내가 좋아서 한 일이야
돈이야 작지만 다 내 땀이야
남자 친구가 사준 반지 아니야
내 차 내 옷 내가 벌어서 산 거야
적금 넣고 부모님 용돈
드리고 나서 산 거야
남자 믿고 놀다 남자 떠나면
어떡할 거야
이런 내가 부러워
부러우면 진 거야

[Intro: Lee Hi]
봄이 와, 꽃을 피우고
여름이 와, 기억이 녹아 내려도

[Verse 1: Tablo]
난 원래 사계절이 어울리지 않아
차가운 아이잖아
모진 성격은 살을 에는 겨울
시린 바람, 알만큼 알잖아
내겐 냉정이 다인 걸
겨울바다 같은 심장인 걸
배를 띄워 다가오면 알겠지
내가 섬이 아닌 빙산인 걸
[Verse 2: Mithra Jin]
난 초점을 잃었지
서리 낀 눈 시린 기억이
밟혀서 목젖 없이 비명만 질렀지
아픈 상처만 남은 빙판이었지
눈사태 난 듯 무너진 맘
추스려 보니 다시 불 꺼진 밤
너란 해가 떠도 눈 덮인 산은 녹지 않아

[Chorus: Lee Hi, Tablo, Lee Hi & Mithra Jin]

봄은 설레며 찾아오지만
난 가을의 끝자락에 서
겨울에 멈춘 기억
따스함은 가뒀어
마른 마음의 튼 살 안에서
얼어붙은 강물에 갇힌 추억
붙잡고 내 손을 놓지 않아
차가웠던 이별을 안 뒤부터
꽃 피던 그 봄은 오지 않아

[OLGA, in the regulation blue dress of a teacher at a girl's high school, is walking about correcting exercise books; MASHA, in a black dress, with a hat on her knees, sits and reads a book; IRINA, in white, stands about, with a thoughtful expression.]

OLGA.
It's just a year since father died last May the fifth, on your name-day, Irina. It was very cold then, and snowing. I thought I would never survive it, and you were in a dead faint. And now a year has gone by and we are already thinking about it without pain, and you are wearing a white dress and your face is happy. [Clock strikes twelve] And the clock struck just the same way then. [Pause] I remember that there was music at the funeral, and they fired a volley in the cemetery. He was a general in command of a brigade but there were few people present. Of course, it was raining then, raining hard, and snowing.

IRINA.
Why think about it!

[BARON
TUZENBACH, CHEBUTIKIN and SOLENI appear by the table in the dining-room, behind the pillars.]
OLGA.
It's so warm to-day that we can keep the windows open, though the birches are not yet in flower. Father was put in command of a brigade, and he rode out of Moscow with us eleven years ago. I remember perfectly that it was early in May and that everything in Moscow was flowering then. It was warm too, everything was bathed in sunshine. Eleven years have gone, and I remember everything as if we rode out only yesterday. Oh, God! When I awoke this morning and saw all the light and the spring, joy entered my heart, and I longed passionately to go home.

CHEBUTIKIN.
Will you take a bet on it?

TUZENBACH.
Oh, nonsense.

[MASHA,
lost in a reverie over her book, whistles softly.]

OLGA.
Don't whistle, Masha. How can you! [Pause] I'm always having headaches from having to go to the High School every day and then teach till evening. Strange thoughts come to me, as if I were already an old woman. And really, during these four years that I have been working here, I have been feeling as if every day my strength and youth have been squeezed out of me, drop by drop. And only one desire grows and gains in strength...

IRINA.
To go away to Moscow. To sell the house, drop everything here, and go to Moscow...

OLGA.
Yes! To Moscow, and as soon as possible.

[CHEBUTIKIN and TUZENBACH laugh.]

IRINA.
I expect Andrey will become a professor, but still, he won't want to live here. Only poor Masha must go on living here.
OLGA.
Masha can come to Moscow every year, for the whole summer.

[MASHA is whistling gently.]

IRINA.
Everything will be arranged, please God. [Looks out of the window] It's nice out to-day. I don't know why I'm so happy: I remembered this morning that it was my name-day, and I suddenly felt glad and remembered my childhood, when mother was still with us. What beautiful thoughts I had, what thoughts!

OLGA.
You're all radiance to-day, I've never seen you look so lovely. And Masha is pretty, too. Andrey wouldn't be bad-looking, if he wasn't so stout; it does spoil his appearance. But I've grown old and very thin, I suppose it's because I get angry with the girls at school. To-day I'm free. I'm at home. I haven't got a headache, and I feel younger than I was yesterday. I'm only twenty-eight.... All's well, God is everywhere, but it seems to me that if only I were married and could stay at home all day, it would be even better. [Pause] I should love my husband.

TUZENBACH.
[To SOLENI] I'm tired of listening to the rot you talk. [Entering the sitting-room] I forgot to say that Vershinin, our new lieutenant-colonel of artillery, is coming to see us to-day. [Sits down to the piano.]

OLGA.
That's good. I'm glad.

IRINA.
Is he old?

TUZENBACH.
Oh, no. Forty or forty-five, at the very outside. [Plays softly] He seems rather a good sort. He's certainly no fool, only he likes to hear himself speak.

IRINA.
Is he interesting?
TUZENBACH.
Oh, he's all right, but there's his wife, his mother-in-law, and two daughters. This is his second wife. He pays calls and tells everybody that he's got a wife and two daughters. He'll tell you so here. The wife isn't all there, she does her hair like a flapper and gushes extremely. She talks philosophy and tries to commit suicide every now and again, apparently in order to annoy her husband. I should have left her long ago, but he bears up patiently, and just grumbles.

SOLENI.
[Enters with CHEBUTIKIN from the dining-room] With one hand I can only lift fifty-four pounds, but with both hands I can lift 180, or even 200 pounds. From this I conclude that two men are not twice as strong as one, but three times, perhaps even more....

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Reads a newspaper as he walks] If your hair is coming out... take an ounce of naphthaline and hail a bottle of spirit... dissolve and use daily.... [Makes a note in his pocket diary] When found make a note of! Not that I want it though.... [Crosses it out] It doesn't matter.

IRINA.
Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch!

CHEBUTIKIN.
What does my own little girl want?

IRINA.
Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch! I feel as if I were sailing under the broad blue sky with great white birds around me. Why is that? Why?

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Kisses her hands, tenderly] My white bird....

IRINA.
When I woke up to-day and got up and dressed myself, I suddenly began to feel as if everything in this life was open to me, and that I knew how I must live. Dear Ivan Romanovitch, I know everything. A man must work, toil in the sweat of his brow, whoever he may be, for that is the meaning and object of his life, his happiness, his enthusiasm. How fine it is to be a workman who gets up at daybreak and breaks stones in the street, or a shepherd, or a schoolmaster, who teaches children, or an engine-driver on the railway.... My God, let alone a man, it's better to be an ox, or just a horse, so long as it can work, than a young woman who wakes up at twelve o'clock, has her coffee in bed, and then spends two hours dressing.... Oh it's awful! Sometimes when it's hot, your thirst can be just as tiresome as my need for work. And if I don't get up early in future and work, Ivan Romanovitch, then you may refuse me your friendship.

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Tenderly] I'll refuse, I'll refuse....

OLGA.
Father used to make us get up at seven. Now Irina wakes at seven and lies and meditates about something till nine at least. And she looks so serious! [Laughs.]

IRINA.
You're so used to seeing me as a little girl that it seems queer to you when my face is serious. I'm twenty!

TUZENBACH.
How well I can understand that craving for work, oh God! I've never worked once in my life. I was born in Petersburg, a chilly, lazy place, in a family which never knew what work or worry meant. I remember that when I used to come home from my regiment, a footman used to have to pull off my boots while I fidgeted and my mother looked on in adoration and wondered why other people didn't see me in the same light. They shielded me from work; but only just in time! A new age is dawning, the people are marching on us all, a powerful, health-giving storm is gathering, it is drawing near, soon it will be upon us and it will drive away laziness, indifference, the prejudice against labour, and rotten dullness from our society. I shall work, and in twenty-five or thirty years, every man will have to work. Every one!

CHEBUTIKIN.
I shan't work.

TUZENBACH.
You don't matter.

SOLENI.
In twenty-five years' time, we shall all be dead, thank the Lord. In two or three years' time apoplexy will carry you off, or else I'll blow your brains out, my pet. [Takes a scent-bottle out of his pocket and sprinkles his chest and hands.]

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Laughs] It's quite true, I never have worked. After I came down from the university I never stirred a finger or opened a book, I just read the papers.... [Takes another newspaper out of his pocket] Here we are.... I've learnt from the papers that there used to be one, Dobrolubov [Note: Dobroluboy (1836-81), in spite of the shortness of his career, established himself as one of the classic literary critics of Russia], for instance, but what he wrote—I don't know... God only knows.... [Somebody is heard tapping on the floor from below] There.... They're calling me downstairs, somebody's come to see me. I'll be back in a minute... won't be long.... [Exit hurriedly, scratching his beard.]

IRINA.
He's up to something.

TUZENBACH.
Yes, he looked so pleased as he went out that I'm pretty certain he'll bring you a present in a moment.

IRINA.
How unpleasant!

OLGA.
Yes, it's awful. He's always doing silly things.

MASHA.

           &nbsp        "There stands a green oak by the sea.
           &nbsp       And a chain of bright gold is around it...
           &nbsp        And a chain of bright gold is around it...."
[Gets up and sings softly.]

OLGA.
You're not very bright to-day, Masha. [MASHA sings, putting on her hat] Where are you off to?

MASHA.
Home.

IRINA.
That's odd....

TUZENBACH.
On a name-day, too!

MASHA.
It doesn't matter. I'll come in the evening. Good-bye, dear. [Kisses MASHA] Many happy returns, though I've said it before. In the old days when father was alive, every time we had a name-day, thirty or forty officers used to come, and there was lots of noise and fun, and to-day there's only a man and a half, and it's as quiet as a desert... I'm off... I've got the hump to-day, and am not at all cheerful, so don't you mind me. [Laughs through her tears] We'll have a talk later on, but good-bye for the present, my dear; I'll go somewhere.

IRINA.
[Displeased] You are queer....

OLGA.
[Crying] I understand you, Masha.

SOLENI.
When a man talks philosophy, well, it is philosophy or at any rate sophistry; but when a woman, or two women, talk philosophy—it's all my eye.

MASHA.
What do you mean by that, you very awful man?

SOLENI.
Oh, nothing. You came down on me before I could say... help! [Pause.]

MASHA.
[Angrily, to OLGA] Don't cry!

[Enter ANFISA and FERAPONT with a cake.]

ANFISA.
This way, my dear. Come in, your feet are clean. [To IRINA] From the District Council, from Mihail Ivanitch Protopopov... a cake.

IRINA.
Thank you. Please thank him. [Takes the cake.]

FERAPONT.
What?

IRINA.
[Louder] Please thank him.

OLGA.
Give him a pie, nurse. Ferapont, go, she'll give you a pie.

FERAPONT.
What?

ANFISA.
Come on, gran'fer, Ferapont Spiridonitch. Come on. [Exeunt.]

MASHA.
I don't like this Mihail Potapitch or Ivanitch, Protopopov. We oughtn't to invite him here.

IRINA.
I never asked him.

MASHA.
That's all right.

[Enter CHEBUTIKIN followed by a soldier with a silver samovar; there is a rumble of dissatisfied surprise.]

OLGA.
[Covers her face with her hands] A samovar! That's awful! [Exit into the dining-room, to the table.]

IRINA.
My dear Ivan Romanovitch, what are you doing!

TUZENBACH.
[Laughs] I told you so!

MASHA.
Ivan Romanovitch, you are simply shameless!

CHEBUTIKIN.
My dear good girl, you are the only thing, and the dearest thing I have in the world. I'll soon be sixty. I'm an old man, a lonely worthless old man. The only good thing in me is my love for you, and if it hadn't been for that, I would have been dead long ago.... [To IRINA] My dear little girl, I've known you since the day of your birth, I've carried you in my arms... I loved your dead mother....

MASHA.
But your presents are so expensive!

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Angrily, through his tears] Expensive presents.... You really, are!... [To the orderly] Take the samovar in there.... [Teasing] Expensive presents!

[The orderly goes into the dining-room with the samovar.]

ANFISA.
[Enters and crosses stage] My dear, there's a strange Colonel come! He's taken off his coat already. Children, he's coming here. Irina darling, you'll be a nice and polite little girl, won't you.... Should have lunched a long time ago.... Oh, Lord.... [Exit.]

TUZENBACH.
It must be Vershinin. [Enter VERSHININ] Lieutenant-Colonel Vershinin!

VERSHININ.
[To MASHA and IRINA] I have the honour to introduce myself, my name is Vershinin. I am very glad indeed to be able to come at last. How you've grown! Oh! oh!

IRINA.
Please sit down. We're very glad you've come.

VERSHININ.
[Gaily] I am glad, very glad! But there are three sisters, surely. I remember—three little girls. I forget your faces, but your father, Colonel Prosorov, used to have three little girls, I remember that perfectly, I saw them with my own eyes. How time does fly! Oh, dear, how it flies!

TUZENBACH.
Alexander Ignateyevitch comes from Moscow.

IRINA.
From Moscow? Are you from Moscow?

VERSHININ.
Yes, that's so. Your father used to be in charge of a battery there, and I was an officer in the same brigade. [To MASHA] I seem to remember your face a little.

MASHA.
I don't remember you.

IRINA.
Olga! Olga! [Shouts into the dining-room] Olga! Come along! [OLGA enters from the dining-room] Lieutenant Colonel Vershinin comes from Moscow, as it happens.

VERSHININ.
I take it that you are Olga Sergeyevna, the eldest, and that you are Maria... and you are Irina, the youngest....

OLGA.
So you come from Moscow?

VERSHININ.
Yes. I went to school in Moscow and began my service there; I was there for a long time until at last I got my battery and moved over here, as you see. I don't really remember you, I only remember that there used to be three sisters. I remember your father well; I have only to shut my eyes to see him as he was. I used to come to your house in Moscow....

OLGA.
I used to think I remembered everybody, but...

VERSHININ.
My name is Alexander Ignateyevitch.

IRINA.
Alexander Ignateyevitch, you've come from Moscow. That is really quite a surprise!

OLGA.
We are going to live there, you see.

IRINA.
We think we may be there this autumn. It's our native town, we were born there. In Old Basmanni Road.... [They both laugh for joy.]

MASHA.
We've unexpectedly met a fellow countryman. [Briskly] I remember: Do you remember, Olga, they used to speak at home of a "lovelorn Major." You were only a Lieutenant then, and in love with somebody, but for some reason they always called you a Major for fun.

VERSHININ.
[Laughs] That's it... the lovelorn Major, that's got it!

MASHA.
You only wore moustaches then. You have grown older! [Through her tears] You have grown older!

VERSHININ.
Yes, when they used to call me the lovelorn Major, I was young and in love. I've grown out of both now.

OLGA.
But you haven't a single white hair yet. You're older, but you're not yet old.

VERSHININ.
I'm forty-two, anyway. Have you been away from Moscow long?

IRINA.
Eleven years. What are you crying for, Masha, you little fool.... [Crying] And I'm crying too.

MASHA.
It's all right. And where did you live?

VERSHININ.
Old Basmanni Road.

OLGA.
Same as we.

VERSHININ.
Once I used to live in German Street. That was when the Red Barracks were my headquarters. There's an ugly bridge in between, where the water rushes underneath. One gets melancholy when one is alone there. [Pause] Here the river is so wide and fine! It's a splendid river!

OLGA.
Yes, but it's so cold. It's very cold here, and the midges....

VERSHININ.
What are you saying! Here you've got such a fine healthy Russian climate. You've a forest, a river... and birches. Dear, modest birches, I like them more than any other tree. It's good to live here. Only it's odd that the railway station should be thirteen miles away.... Nobody knows why.

SOLENI.
I know why. [All look at him] Because if it was near it wouldn't be far off, and if it's far off, it can't be near. [An awkward pause.]

TUZENBACH.
Funny man.

OLGA.
Now I know who you are. I remember.

VERSHININ.
I used to know your mother.

CHEBUTIKIN.
She was a good woman, rest her soul.

IRINA.
Mother is buried in Moscow.

OLGA.
At the Novo-Devichi Cemetery.

MASHA.
Do you know, I'm beginning to forget her face. We'll be forgotten in just the same way.

VERSHININ.
Yes, they'll forget us. It's our fate, it can't be helped. A time will come when everything that seems serious, significant, or very important to us will be forgotten, or considered trivial. [Pause] And the curious thing is that we can't possibly find out what will come to be regarded as great and important, and what will be feeble, or silly. Didn't the discoveries of Copernicus, or Columbus, say, seem unnecessary and ludicrous at first, while wasn't it thought that some rubbish written by a fool, held all the truth? And it may so happen that our present existence, with which we are so satisfied, will in time appear strange, inconvenient, stupid, unclean, perhaps even sinful....

TUZENBACH.
Who knows? But on the other hand, they may call our life noble and honour its memory. We've abolished torture and capital punishment, we live in security, but how much suffering there is still!

SOLENI.
[In a feeble voice] There, there.... The Baron will go without his dinner if you only let him talk philosophy.

TUZENBACH.
Vassili Vassilevitch, kindly leave me alone. [Changes his chair] You're very dull, you know.

SOLENI.
[Feebly] There, there, there.

TUZENBACH.
[To VERSHININ] The sufferings we see to-day—there are so many of them!—still indicate a certain moral improvement in society.

VERSHININ.
Yes, yes, of course.

CHEBUTIKIN.
You said just now, Baron, that they may call our life noble; but we are very petty.... [Stands up] See how little I am. [Violin played behind.]

MASHA.
That's Andrey playing—our brother.

IRINA.
He's the learned member of the family. I expect he will be a professor some day. Father was a soldier, but his son chose an academic career for himself.

MASHA.
That was father's wish.

OLGA.
We ragged him to-day. We think he's a little in love.

IRINA.
To a local lady. She will probably come here to-day.

MASHA.
You should see the way she dresses! Quite prettily, quite fashionably too, but so badly! Some queer bright yellow skirt with a wretched little fringe and a red bodice. And such a complexion! Andrey isn't in love. After all he has taste, he's simply making fun of us. I heard yesterday that she was going to marry Protopopov, the chairman of the Local Council. That would do her nicely.... [At the side door] Andrey, come here! Just for a minute, dear! [Enter ANDREY.]

OLGA.
My brother, Andrey Sergeyevitch.

VERSHININ.
My name is Vershinin.

ANDREY.
Mine is Prosorov. [Wipes his perspiring hands] You've come to take charge of the battery?

OLGA.
Just think, Alexander Ignateyevitch comes from Moscow.

ANDREY.
That's all right. Now my little sisters won't give you any rest.

VERSHININ.
I've already managed to bore your sisters.

IRINA.
Just look what a nice little photograph frame Andrey gave me to-day. [Shows it] He made it himself.

VERSHININ.
[Looks at the frame and does not know what to say] Yes.... It's a thing that...

IRINA.
And he made that frame there, on the piano as well. [Andrey waves his hand and walks away.]

OLGA.
He's got a degree, and plays the violin, and cuts all sorts of things out of wood, and is really a domestic Admirable Crichton. Don't go away, Andrey! He's got into a habit of always going away. Come here!

[MASHA and IRINA take his arms and laughingly lead him back.]

MASHA.
Come on, come on!

ANDREY.
Please leave me alone.

MASHA.
You are funny. Alexander Ignateyevitch used to be called the lovelorn Major, but he never minded.

VERSHININ.
Not the least.

MASHA.
I'd like to call you the lovelorn fiddler!

IRINA.
Or the lovelorn professor!

OLGA.
He's in love! little Andrey is in love!

IRINA.
[Applauds] Bravo, Bravo! Encore! Little Andrey is in love.

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Goes up behind ANDREY and takes him round the waist with both arms] Nature only brought us into the world that we should love! [Roars with laughter, then sits down and reads a newspaper which he takes out of his pocket.]

ANDREY.
That's enough, quite enough.... [Wipes his face] I couldn't sleep all night and now I can't quite find my feet, so to speak. I read until four o'clock, then tried to sleep, but nothing happened. I thought about one thing and another, and then it dawned and the sun crawled into my bedroom. This summer, while I'm here, I want to translate a book from the English....

VERSHININ.
Do you read English?

ANDREY.
Yes father, rest his soul, educated us almost violently. It may seem funny and silly, but it's nevertheless true, that after his death I began to fill out and get rounder, as if my body had had some great pressure taken off it. Thanks to father, my sisters and I know French, German, and English, and Irina knows Italian as well. But we paid dearly for it all!

MASHA.
A knowledge of three languages is an unnecessary luxury in this town. It isn't even a luxury but a sort of useless extra, like a sixth finger. We know a lot too much.

VERSHININ.
Well, I say! [Laughs] You know a lot too much! I don't think there can really be a town so dull and stupid as to have no place for a clever, cultured person. Let us suppose even that among the hundred thousand inhabitants of this backward and uneducated town, there are only three persons like yourself. It stands to reason that you won't be able to conquer that dark mob around you; little by little as you grow older you will be bound to give way and lose yourselves in this crowd of a hundred thousand human beings; their life will suck you up in itself, but still, you won't disappear having influenced nobody; later on, others like you will come, perhaps six of them, then twelve, and so on, until at last your sort will be in the majority. In two or three hundred years' time life on this earth will be unimaginably beautiful and wonderful. Mankind needs such a life, and if it is not ours to-day then we must look ahead for it, wait, think, prepare for it. We must see and know more than our fathers and grandfathers saw and knew. [Laughs] And you complain that you know too much.

MASHA.
[Takes off her hat] I'll stay to lunch.

IRINA.
[Sighs] Yes, all that ought to be written down.

[ANDREY has gone out quietly.]

TUZENBACH.
You say that many years later on, life on this earth will be beautiful and wonderful. That's true. But to share in it now, even though at a distance, we must prepare by work....

VERSHININ.
[Gets up] Yes. What a lot of flowers you have. [Looks round] It's a beautiful flat. I envy you! I've spent my whole life in rooms with two chairs, one sofa, and fires which always smoke. I've never had flowers like these in my life.... [Rubs his hands] Well, well!

TUZENBACH.
Yes, we must work. You are probably thinking to yourself: the German lets himself go. But I assure you I'm a Russian, I can't even speak German. My father belonged to the Orthodox Church.... [Pause.]

VERSHININ.
[Walks about the stage] I often wonder: suppose we could begin life over again, knowing what we were doing? Suppose we could use one life, already ended, as a sort of rough draft for another? I think that every one of us would try, more than anything else, not to repeat himself, at the very least he would rearrange his manner of life, he would make sure of rooms like these, with flowers and light... I have a wife and two daughters, my wife's health is delicate and so on and so on, and if I had to begin life all over again I would not marry.... No, no!

[Enter KULIGIN in a regulation jacket.]

KULIGIN.
[Going up to IRINA] Dear sister, allow me to congratulate you on the day sacred to your good angel and to wish you, sincerely and from the bottom of my heart, good health and all that one can wish for a girl of your years. And then let me offer you this book as a present. [Gives it to her] It is the history of our High School during the last fifty years, written by myself. The book is worthless, and written because I had nothing to do, but read it all the same. Good day, gentlemen! [To VERSHININ] My name is Kuligin, I am a master of the local High School. [Note: He adds that he is a Nadvorny Sovetnik (almost the same as a German Hofrat), an undistinguished civilian title with no English equivalent.] [To IRINA] In this book you will find a list of all those who have taken the full course at our High School during these fifty years. Feci quod potui, faciant meliora potentes. [Kisses MASHA.]

IRINA.
But you gave me one of these at Easter.

KULIGIN.
[Laughs] I couldn't have, surely! You'd better give it back to me in that case, or else give it to the Colonel. Take it, Colonel. You'll read it some day when you're bored.

VERSHININ.
Thank you. [Prepares to go] I am extremely happy to have made the acquaintance of...

OLGA.
Must you go? No, not yet?

IRINA.
You'll stop and have lunch with us. Please do.

OLGA.
Yes, please!

VERSHININ.
[Bows] I seem to have dropped in on your name-day. Forgive me, I didn't know, and I didn't offer you my congratulations. [Goes with OLGA into the dining-room.]

KULIGIN.
To-day is Sunday, the day of rest, so let us rest and rejoice, each in a manner compatible with his age and disposition. The carpets will have to be taken up for the summer and put away till the winter... Persian powder or naphthaline.... The Romans were healthy because they knew both how to work and how to rest, they had mens sana in corpore sano. Their life ran along certain recognized patterns. Our director says: "The chief thing about each life is its pattern. Whoever loses his pattern is lost himself"—and it's just the same in our daily life. [Takes MASHA by the waist, laughing] Masha loves me. My wife loves me. And you ought to put the window curtains away with the carpets.... I'm feeling awfully pleased with life to-day. Masha, we've got to be at the director's at four. They're getting up a walk for the pedagogues and their families.

MASHA.
I shan't go.

KULIGIN.
[Hurt] My dear Masha, why not?

MASHA.
I'll tell you later.... [Angrily] All right, I'll go, only please stand back.... [Steps away.]

KULIGIN.
And then we're to spend the evening at the director's. In spite of his ill-health that man tries, above everything else, to be sociable. A splendid, illuminating personality. A wonderful man. After yesterday's committee he said to me: "I'm tired, Feodor Ilitch, I'm tired!" [Looks at the clock, then at his watch] Your clock is seven minutes fast. "Yes," he said, "I'm tired." [Violin played off.]

OLGA.
Let's go and have lunch! There's to be a masterpiece of baking!

KULIGIN.
Oh my dear Olga, my dear. Yesterday I was working till eleven o'clock at night, and got awfully tired. To-day I'm quite happy. [Goes into dining-room] My dear...

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Puts his paper into his pocket, and combs his beard] A pie? Splendid!

MASHA.
[Severely to CHEBUTIKIN] Only mind; you're not to drink anything to-day. Do you hear? It's bad for you.

CHEBUTIKIN.
Oh, that's all right. I haven't been drunk for two years. And it's all the same, anyway!

MASHA.
You're not to dare to drink, all the same. [Angrily, but so that her husband should not hear] Another dull evening at the Director's, confound it!

TUZENBACH.
I shouldn't go if I were you.... It's quite simple.

CHEBUTIKIN.
Don't go.

MASHA.
Yes, "don't go...." It's a cursed, unbearable life.... [Goes into dining-room.]

CHEBUTIKIN.
[Follows her] It's not so bad.

SOLENI.
[Going into the dining-room] There, there, there....

TUZENBACH.
Vassili Vassilevitch, that's enough. Be quiet!

SOLENI.
There, there, there....

KULIGIN.
[Gaily] Your health, Colonel! I'm a pedagogue and not quite at home here. I'm Masha's husband.... She's a good sort, a very good sort.

VERSHININ.
I'll have some of this black vodka.... [Drinks] Your health! [To OLGA] I'm very comfortable here!

[Only IRINA and TUZENBACH are now left in the sitting-room.]

IRINA.
Masha's out of sorts to-day. She married when she was eighteen, when he seemed to her the wisest of men. And now it's different. He's the kindest man, but not the wisest.

OLGA.
[Impatiently] Andrey, when are you coming?

ANDREY.
[Off] One minute. [Enters and goes to the table.]

TUZENBACH.
What are you thinking about?

IRINA.
I don't like this Soleni of yours and I'm afraid of him. He only says silly things.

TUZENBACH.
He's a queer man. I'm sorry for him, though he vexes me. I think he's shy. When there are just the two of us he's quite all right and very good company; when other people are about he's rough and hectoring. Don't let's go in, let them have their meal without us. Let me stay with you. What are you thinking of? [Pause] You're twenty. I'm not yet thirty. How many years are there left to us, with their long, long lines of days, filled with my love for you....

IRINA.
Nicolai Lvovitch, don't speak to me of love.

TUZENBACH.
[Does not hear] I've a great thirst for life, struggle, and work, and this thirst has united with my love for you, Irina, and you're so beautiful, and life seems so beautiful to me! What are you thinking about?

IRINA.
You say that life is beautiful. Yes, if only it seems so! The life of us three hasn't been beautiful yet; it has been stifling us as if it was weeds... I'm crying. I oughtn't.... [Dries her tears, smiles] We must work, work. That is why we are unhappy and look at the world so sadly; we don't know what work is. Our parents despised work....

[Enter NATALIA IVANOVA; she wears a pink dress and a green sash.]

NATASHA.
They're already at lunch... I'm late... [Carefully examines herself in a mirror, and puts herself straight] I think my hair's done all right.... [Sees IRINA] Dear Irina Sergeyevna, I congratulate you! [Kisses her firmly and at length] You've so many visitors, I'm really ashamed.... How do you do, Baron!

OLGA.
[Enters from dining-room] Here's Natalia Ivanovna. How are you, dear! [They kiss.]

NATASHA.
Happy returns. I'm awfully shy, you've so many people here.

OLGA.
All our friends. [Frightened, in an undertone] You're wearing a green sash! My dear, you shouldn't!

NATASHA.
Is it a sign of anything?

OLGA.
No, it simply doesn't go well... and it looks so queer.

NATASHA.
[In a tearful voice] Yes? But it isn't really green, it's too dull for that. [Goes into dining-room with OLGA.]
[They have all sat down to lunch in the dining-room, the sitting-room is empty.]

KULIGIN.
I wish you a nice fiancée, Irina. It's quite time you married.

CHEBUTIKIN.
Natalia Ivanovna, I wish you the same.

KULIGIN.
Natalia Ivanovna has a fiancé already.

MASHA.
[Raps with her fork on a plate] Let's all get drunk and make life purple for once!

KULIGIN.
You've lost three good conduct marks.

VERSHININ.
This is a nice drink. What's it made of?

SOLENI.
Blackbeetles.

IRINA.
[Tearfully] Phoo! How disgusting!

OLGA.
There is to be a roast turkey and a sweet apple pie for dinner. Thank goodness I can spend all day and the evening at home. You'll come in the evening, ladies and gentlemen....

VERSHININ.
And please may I come in the evening!

IRINA.
Please do.

NATASHA.
They don't stand on ceremony here.

CHEBUTIKIN.
Nature only brought us into the world that we should love! [Laughs.]

ANDREY.
[Angrily] Please don't! Aren't you tired of it?

[Enter FEDOTIK and RODE with a large basket of flowers.]

FEDOTIK.
They're lunching already.

RODE.
[Loudly and thickly] Lunching? Yes, so they are....

FEDOTIK.
Wait a minute! [Takes a photograph] That's one. No, just a moment.... [Takes another] That's two. Now we're ready!

[They take the basket and go into the dining-room, where they have a noisy reception.]

RODE.
[Loudly] Congratulations and best wishes! Lovely weather to-day, simply perfect. Was out walking with the High School students all the morning. I take their drills.

FEDOTIK.
You may move, Irina Sergeyevna! [Takes a photograph] You look well to-day. [Takes a humming-top out of his pocket] Here's a humming-top, by the way. It's got a lovely note!

IRINA.
How awfully nice!

MASHA.

           &nbsp        "There stands a green oak by the sea,
           &nbsp        And a chain of bright gold is around it...
           &nbsp        And a chain of bright gold is around it..."
[Tearfully] What am I saying that for? I've had those words running in my head all day....

KULIGIN.
There are thirteen at table!

RODE.
[Aloud] Surely you don't believe in that superstition? [Laughter.]

KULIGIN.
If there are thirteen at table then it means there are lovers present. It isn't you, Ivan Romanovitch, hang it all.... [Laughter.]

CHEBUTIKIN.
I'm a hardened sinner, but I really don't see why Natalia Ivanovna should blush....

[Loud laughter; NATASHA runs out into the sitting-room, followed by ANDREY.]

ANDREY.
Don't pay any attention to them! Wait... do stop, please....

NATASHA.
I'm shy... I don't know what's the matter with me and they're all laughing at me. It wasn't nice of me to leave the table like that, but I can't... I can't. [Covers her face with her hands.]

ANDREY.
My dear, I beg you. I implore you not to excite yourself. I assure you they're only joking, they're kind people. My dear, good girl, they're all kind and sincere people, and they like both you and me. Come here to the window, they can't see us here.... [Looks round.]

NATASHA.
I'm so unaccustomed to meeting people!

ANDREY.
Oh your youth, your splendid, beautiful youth! My darling, don't be so excited! Believe me, believe me... I'm so happy, my soul is full of love, of ecstasy.... They don't see us! They can't! Why, why or when did I fall in love with you—Oh, I can't understand anything. My dear, my pure darling, be my wife! I love you, love you... as never before.... [They kiss.]
[Two officers come in and, seeing the lovers kiss, stop in astonishment.]

[Verse 1: T.O.P, G-Dragon & Taeyang]
오랜만이야
못 본 사이
그댄 얼굴이 좋아 보여
예뻐졌다
넌 항상 내 눈엔 원래 고와 보여
근데 오늘따라 조금 달라 보여
유난히 뭔가 더 차가워 보여
나를 보는 눈빛이 동정에 가득 차 있어
네 앞에서 난 작아 보여
괜찮은 척 애써 대화 주제를 바꿔 버려
묻고 싶은 말은 많은데 넌 딱 잘라 버려
네 긴 머린 찰랑거려
내 볼을 때리곤 스쳐지나
뒤돌아선 곧장 가 버려
여기서 널 잡으면 우스워지나
아무 말도 떠오르지 않죠
떨면서 넌 한두 발짝 뒤로
이젠 내가 무섭단 그 말
날 미치게 하는 너란 달
[Chorus: Daesung & Taeyang]
I love you, baby
I'm not a monster

무슨 일이 있어도 영원하자고
슬플 때도 기쁠 때도 끝까지 하자고
You don't say that tomorrow
오늘이 마지막인 것처럼 사랑하자고
Yo, 너 없는 삶은 종신형, 세상과 단절돼 돌 지경이야
너란 존재는 고질병, 시련의 연속, 마음속 미련이야
세상 사람들이 내게 돌린 등 (등)
모든 것이 배배 꼬여 있던 눈초리들
내게 가장 큰 아픔은 (아픔은)
네가 그들 같아졌단 것뿐

English (Translated)

[Intro: G-Dragon]
I’m tired of being alone
Sick of being single
I think I need me a girl
I need a girl like

[Verse 1: Taeyang]
One that speaks without thinking
Not a little child, but one that will embrace me
Not a girl that plays around sometimes when she’s bored
But one that will only love me
Even if she stays still and guys hand her their phone
That kind of girl that will proudly
Take out and show my picture

[Chorus 1: Taeyang]
Girl, I need a girl, pretty no matter what she does
A pretty body, too
Girl, I need a girl Baby, I need you
Girl, you need me, too

[Verse 2: Taeyang]
A kind of girl that looks better
In jeans than a skirt
A girl that will eat the kimchi fried rice
That I make instead
A girl who looks young even though she’s old
I like that kind of girl
(Know what I mean)

[Verse 3: Taeyang]
A girl that acts shy, but knows how to be bold
Always pretends to careful of her behavior
But when you’re with her
Hmm, y’all know what I’m talking about

[Chorus 2: Taeyang & G-Dragon]
Girl, I need a girl, pretty no matter what she does
A pretty body, too
Girl, I need a girl, I like this kind of girl

[Verse 4: G-Dragon]
Looks are not an issue but a cute girl who knows style
Even though our hobbies are different
Our tastes are the same
A girl that I can relate to a lot
When we watch movies or listen to music

[Verse 5: G-Dragon]
(Yes!) I love girls, girls I do adore
In front of people, she has principles as she plays
In front of me, she’s like “A’ing, I don’t know”
A voice that wakes me up in the morning
[Morning Kiss] I want to start the day
I’ll learn on your knees at night
As I listen to a lullaby, I want to dream of you

[Bridge: Taeyang]
Make my heart race again
Make me able to create sweet songs again
You know, it's not about the money or something like that
You’re the person I want to give my heart to

[Verse 6: Taeyang]
Girl, I need a girl, mmm
Girl like you, gotta make you mine
I’m treat you right, baby

[Chorus 1: Taeyang]
Girl, I need a girl, pretty no matter what she does
A pretty body, too
Girl, I need a girl, baby, I need you
Girl, you need me too

[Outro: Taeyang]
Girl, I need a girl
Girl, I need a girl
Girl, are you listening to me?
Baby, I need you, Girl, you need me, too
Girl, I need a girl

I'm gonna live my life slow, at a comfortable pace
They call me granddad, cause it's written all over my face
My behaviour's controlled
No need to make the most of tonight, 'cuz I'm gonna die old

Live fast die old

[Verse 1]
Not that old, 23
Got my life ahead of me
What's the point in having fun?
I'll do it when I'm 81
My favourite party's when nobody attends (You Know)
I'm in pants my watching a box set of Friends (For Sure)
[Break]
Oh my god... They're at it again (yeah)
Making my songs sound better again (double rhyme)
Parody is easy see, the words are right in front of me
Ke$ha is the best to do, cause her words are already poo

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Different song, same old shit
Long as it gets YouTube hits
MSN, after ten
You're really gonna do that joke again?
You thought that we'd be better, we been three years now together
Still got semen on my sweater from the one time we met Ke$ha
When I rap I slur, yes I got a lisp sir
Least I'm not rapping half pissed like Ke$ha

[Break]
Oh my god... They've done it once more (yeah)
Making a song that makes me look like a whore
Those gorgeous brits, they can't be controlled
The party don't start till we get old

[Bridge]
This is the part where we break it down
This is the part where we eat a clown
This is the part where the DJ skips
This is the part where we show our nips

Baby, come back
A-yo, Choice, drop it on me
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
그날 밤은 내가 너무 심했어
네가 진짜로 떠나갈 줄은 몰랐어
"내가 미안해" 이 말 한마디 어려워서
우린 끝까지 가, 내 성격이 더러워서
말도 안 되는 일로 다투기를 하루에도 수십 번
넌 울면서 뛰쳐나가, 난 주위를 두리번
다시 돌아오겠지, 내일이면
분명 먼저 연락이 오겠지, 아침이면

보통 남자와 달라 너무 힘들다고 (Yeah)
넌 아직도 소녀같이 너무 여려 (Uh huh)
매일같이 웃어 주는 네 곁엔 내가 너무 어려
바쁘다는 핑계로 약속을 미뤄 버려

[Интро]
Чист

[Куплет 1]
Где же мы? Где же ты?
Где же я? Где же вы?
Что со мной? Я устал
Моя жизнь — вот мой страх
Кто же я? Кто же ты?
Мои сны — лишь мечты
Я не там — я не тот
Где мой знак? Я не смог
[Припев]
Я забыл, что значит жить
Я забыл все свои мысли
Мои слова словно числа
Мои слова словно числа
В каждом моменте — я лишний
В каждой вселенной  — я лишний
Все мои маски не видишь
Просто прошу вас, потише

[Куплет 2]
Я хочу уйти, я хочу назад
Я хочу забыть, я хочу во мрак
Снова этот сон, снова как назло
Снова этот день, снова я не тот
Все мои слова — всё это так зря
Затоптал свой путь — повернуть бы вспять
Чтобы и не ты — чтобы и не я
Чтобы и не жизнь, чтобы темнота

[Припев]
Я забыл что значит жить
Я забыл все свои мысли
Мои слова словно числа
Мои слова словно числа
Я забыл, что значит жить
Я забыл все свои мысли
Мои слова словно числа
Мои слова словно числаYou might also likeEmbedDaylyt vs. Serius Jones Lyrics[Verse 1: Daylyt]
Serius, Serius, Serius, let me hand you a tip
You battling a Prince, the Purple Rain king you see the kid in his great fit
I scream “Free Quincy!” that’s the same sound when it’s plane round
The Cheerio taste with the main style from James Brown
Now that I’m on they good foot I give em a straight kick
Great spit, you could tell by my Caesar I’m finna go ape shit
The goon who demand for the band put two in symphony
You doomed mentally, I’m who you called out
For saying I’m drawn out, that’s why they tune into me
I make the house sell, I’m who they adore, knock killing
All that hot grillin, get hit with the four man
You in fear to be hurt?
Jerk if this appear to be work, then we can get along, sure man
But if we can’t? He come back to win, he Siamese lunch
Chinese crunch, chin smashers, not to chase
Get in my rocket space, we’ll send NASA
Death, skin grafter, body line, puppet, fuck it I’m the pin master
Every round that I come in contact with
Show y’all that it’s nothing on the Lens Crafter
I’m past the faze, Church, half god, half man, I’m Hercules nigga
I scare the soul, Derrick Rose, I’m hurting these niggas
Please nigga, ya last catch was bass fresh, you who they sent to see
But you the staff rep for bad breath, this shit was meant to be
But it’s cold breath for the old ref, he been official
Old ref beneficial nigga you’ll probably die in a year
For the simpleton fans, I’m the Michelin man, I body entire careers
Wait soldier, don’t panic it’s the planet takeover
The plate holder, I terraform the terror, the goblin killer
Y’all know I’m a problem nigga, I’m from the era
When Mook, Lux left the game with the dead smell
It was passin for a stink
I held up, played Zelda, I had everybody asking for the Link
Jones don’t be phony, homie you know me, we decode the cold truth
I seen the totem pole, I was right there on that golden road too
I’m the same pup from the yellow brick road, but you who I’ma total dog
I black, Liberia, the god fearin the guy who meet every criteria
And that’s why I’m the pro to call (protocol)
Now they giving me crazy hugs, baby love, put me on a cupid card
Went from being the square-pants of the rap list, now I’m Patrick
The whole world calling me a stupid star
But that’s on every magazine print nigga
We press the issue on niggas who scared of loc’in
We hope he go but he Pinocchio
Boy would ride out but ya pedals broken
You wanna be a winner that much? If they write he could be cold
Gun like the Matrix too you're right it could reload
Dick head done got into a warm mess, you like the pussy hole
Defeat/the feet will swing in ya circle, you like to Tootsie Roll
But I rep Watts, that’s the team then
You knew I was gon come correct when you see men
Lyt across, I’m a writing boss, that’s why they call me king pin
This shit's a breeze, a ease then a sneeze when I met you niggas
God bless you niggas,I gotta rap, at the bottom slack
But I just might address you niggas
I flesh you niggas, I rest you niggas, the rest you niggas come and get me
Moral of the story, when I’m serious Serius, you not fuckin with me
Lyt…
SERIUS JONES

They said “you wanna battle on Ether vers’ Daylyt?”
I said “he gotta be just rap”
But as you can see soon as we get here, it’s like ya outfit
An obvious mismatch
I heard you was gon do some Inception thing
Ain’t that the beginning of something? Then that’s retarded
Cuz off the head this shit done already ended before it started
I heard Quill could see the definition to see if Quill was representing
But if it’s Quill as in penning something ill then that’s forgiving
But it’s not very gangster, in fact it’s not very clever as a nerd
Ask Mickey if this is Facts cuz I dissected the word
And Quill is a form in a thin tube and the main tailfeather of a bird
So that’s what you repping on ya neck? A thin tube or gay bird?
You mean to tell me a Crip from Watts
Writes his rhymes shaking a tailfeather? Say word
And you must be drinking ink to think Day writing is better
Oh I get it, you Quill cuz your bars they light as a feather
So the Queen Of The Ring wanna be the King Of The Dots
Until you get beamed out of this planet and since ya antics is all a scheme
Let’s make a scheme out of ya antics
I did the Math on you, try to sleep me on stage I’ll divide you in half
Till ya feet get splashed
Take them Spawn boots off you then ski on ya mask
Ya shine is a Thriller jacket, zip em up
If you the slave then I’m the master bruh
I’m on the Interstate in a Challenger with 3 Ks
Ready to put them white sheets on you so you could stay in character
See you not Batman Day, you not even Bruce Wayne you a liar
But I’ll tell you off the bat man, you so marked out
You should change ya last name to McGuire
See you gon die after the shit I say today to Day
It’s no more to combat when I put that gun in ya mouth
And say “don’t move” and you say “mkay mkay”
See you a booty shot, I couldn’t sell you light or tell you shake
And if I squeezed on you ya body would wind up so out of place
They could tell you fake
See if you wouldn’t tell not to be ya cell mate
I might could sell you weight
Now the Doctor’s gon have to wait til cells mate
To make the drugs they gotta help you take
I take this fool to a splash, turn ya bitch into a pool
Turn ya food into a bag, dripping through a tube
I get you blue like ya rag when you gripping on the tool
I’m flamed up like ya flag when you Bicken Back Bein Bool
You old day, but that’s okay cuz I bought the juice to Los Angeles
That mean I bring the steel with me, pinch ya bitch up over a Q
And they can't even tell who old man quill is
Old Man Quiles, Bishop, Juice, Steel, Los Angeles
I change ya ceiling but I don’t paint with ladders, these ladders they paint
You try to climb up in my window early morn’
Turn Spawn to a latter day Saint
You can’t pull a wool over a wolf’s eyes, I pull that wool up on em
My bars is so hard, niggas in the yard do pull-ups on em
Before y’all came on stage I hope y’all put some pull-ups on em
Cuz I’ma pull out on em soon as I pull up on em
See I’m the man that fucked Pam in San Fran and made the Bay-watch
Cave gun lines in ya face, you know how Tay Roc
Speaking of Roc, I don’t care how chiseled you are
Cuz pressure make diamonds but granted
You lost ya marbles, we diggin you
Show you how to get cooked on TV, no Emeril
Do this Amber Alert ass nigga biblical
Oh you don’t see where I’m going here yet?
I figured since he robbed the culture
So let’s give him the fate of the thief and stone him to death
I’m the one, you got more for us, never can never, that’s ya spaceship
Before you take the red pill hit em with a flying knee
Yo look like he was doing the Matrix
And I wasn’t gon say shit bout this gay shit
But let me get this straight, quick
Okay, so you a gangsta and a nerd, you a faggot and you straight
Who wears a mask over the mask you already tatted on ya face
So you Batman and you’re Spawn, you’re Daylyt and you’re Quill
But you know what that means, if you’re all those you’re nobody for real
I treat this like a drug deal, you might say why
Cuz my attitude is like the fiends, never cared if Day/they die
I remember when I was young nigga I tested some
I got shook, it had my brain fried
The point of the story is I ain’t get paranoid since I was Yay high
Ain’t no intervention can tame yo life
You like a coke head with a weak nose
You keep hitting the same line twice
You try to spoon me, I’ma pull the burner on this blue flame
You get tied up, shot, just for being a heroin vein (hero in vain)
I got that petico, ask Lush One, he knows
Address me and get violated if I’m P.O.’d
You thought I might slip and maybe lose a round, but no I reload
You about to get 84 grammed, nigga that’s 3 O’d
You go!

Well after the Math punch you was ‘yay’ hi
Skill is something I could loan (cologne) you, but it might cost nigga
Patience, they say it’s hard to give cadence to the fragrance of a lost nigga
But I could tell by ya voice you smell like Detroit
That explains why his last round was decent (D scent)
I mean the man still don’t understand what I’m saying when I say
I’m concrete crippin, but nigga you gon find out what the C meant
Let’s put this stone
You ready to rock? Sure let’s get nastier than when they watch Borat
Based on what my mind crafted it’s gon put everybody in box format
I’m God, it’s true I got em los
Punches i land I’m too Bahamas los
Double bars I’m too Guantanamo
Piranha flow, snapping, rapping for the long drop, the crew Geronimo
You not for the drama, even my mama know, you too comical
It’s crucial, ya crew should vaminos, they gotta know
It’s only one I bitch, in this future I’ma show
In the future I’ma show nobody better
We don’t do gambling with females
The outer stop but the middle will/wheel continue
They like goddamn she on a Sprewell/spree well
That’s just the Watts route
Nigga I seen pop shoot up from the top couch
Since a kid I sense zones, it’s the Flinstones
Nigga I grew up in a rock house
Where every second it could happen nigga, K up beside the bed
Draw the chrome

But I said any second it could happen nigga
Pops told me never hesitate to slap a nigga
With the heater boy, it’s Vegeta boy, I’ll nap a (Nappa) nigga
Before I befriend you
I mean ya whole team look a lil sweet, they kinda Ginyu
I’ll amend you, all you can (shoryuken) be flames you tried the Ken move
Dollar menu, let’s keep it a buck
If the levees break for these geeks, it’s bad luck
We set it straight, I’m Kevin Gates, I’m just eating his ass up
Say hello to Daylyt, AKA Mr. Spazz Life
If we clash, it’s Steve Nash, I show you that I’m past nice
But I often wait, off the gate, you’ll find out what I’m fence to do
I chrome round money, I hope that make sense to you
No? Okay, they give Jones the start, it’s all play dough
Volcano, ya tip hold the spark
They call Day tho, it’s a Tornado, I come to rip homes apart
Shit, Jones a mark
They don’t know if ya bitch nigga, bitch bitch nigga
The bitch just Madea
But just know ya ass would be grass in a split second, “Ch-ch-ch-chia!”
Take a close look at my brother, thuggin like a mafucker
Tat on his face too nigga, you know the signs
Even my granny will clap, for a murkin fee she murk with ease
Nigga my whole family clap, “Hercules! Hercules!”
If the legends had a list, nigga you’d come in super last
You like Serena Williams, over the net you super ass
One line will smoke em, I got in my hookah stash
You like a cape on a garbage can, this nigga super trash
SERIUS JONES

That’s cute he came with the fam, but see I’m a forefather
But after son I see why battle rap’s missin me cuz look what they givin me
A nigga reppin Crip with the most red flags in battle rap history
But see I don’t just take off, I take offers
It’s too late for Daylyt’s Savings when I make Day darker
See I’m a vampire that ain’t scared of sun
And it’s time somebody put dog on a leash and I’m the Day walker
They asked me “why would I take this battle?”
I said cuz technically this is the most challenging position to be in
And if you don’t get it then peep then cuz I’ma give y’all the reason
See I been hit up by demons
I done battled in the prisons to the cement
I even last time on stage I had bitches twerkin
Y’all see when they shit on the P
But I never been on stage with a nigga that might start
Twerking, shitting or peeing
I mean, who raised you my nigga?
Well if it was ya moms then
And it wasn’t them grape street crips and Watts’n
I don’t get it cuz I know some killers from Bompton
Some 60’s from Carson, and them Jordan Down niggas is hard man
And I know they might string yo ass up
But I didn’t know they start letting niggas in thongs in
I can’t believe that over the C’s they ain’t sock you in yo head
For making the set look like some homemade G thang
Slow it down, I said I can’t believe that overseas
You had a sock on ya dickhead and a homemade G string
And we know this grape is a fruit
But I don’t know how y’all let him walk through y’all hood
Cuz now we know when he say he butt naked with the shotgun
He probably talking bout Suge
I don’t see the Lyt of Day, I heard he was a L evader (elevator)
Well I eat the same Rice as Ray, so let’s see what they ravin’ bout
Cuz when we riding in the streets, some things you can’t just write away
So let’s play a conversation out
Let’s say you crip walking down grape street, and see the homies
They deep and like “Aye Day, come smoke some this cookie it’s real loud”
What you gon say? “Aye wassup cuz, I’m just showing my ass for the set
You know I’m trying to make Tookie be proud
You only making noise cuz you a loud ass nigga
You know that “I’m not coming around if that nigga’s around” ass nigga
Sir cuz (Circus) like he the ring master and jump off trampoline
But need tricks to make it through a fire round ass nigga
I think we all know what we call those, clown ass niggas!
This bitch nigga see a gangbang and say “let’s be in” (lesbian)
Drama I bust too, fuck the DOC we could go there now
But when the pigs out fox him it’s “Momma I love you, POP hold it down”
I don’t see the law, yeah I’m legally blind just like shorty
You get one of mines booked, we wrap ya paperwork around the shank
Stick you with ya side of the story
See I shit on stages, you don’t shit on stages
You just be reaching and straining, that’s ya gut
You got a fight going on inside you so I take CLIPS, hit ya SOUL through ya ABs
Calm that shit down and break that shit up
And if you still got some OG’s Aktive, they should be very scared
Cuz they macking with wavy Jerry hair, and one spray at ya OG’s top
Activator everywhere
It’s mack in the arena, it’s on mack in the arena
And I brought that mac in the arena
It’s old but it’s still playing yeah that Mac’s a ringer
When you get hit, he won’t know if he lost his keys
Got hit six times or doing the Macarena
My demeanors meaner, I’m Kujo, no Boris, y’all singers
I make you collapse on stage
You won’t wake up out ya coma til August, Alsina
I told you stay on ya toes, but you put on a leotard and a cape
Fuck is you a ballerina?
For awhile now I was tied down by the same ropes I once showed niggas
Almost buried by the same shovels I gave gold diggers
For fifth’ers blazing in glory quote Jones scriptures
I was smacking cats off camera before Smack could even grow whiskers
I put in work! You job ass niggas is ass
I come through like a backwards Moses
Cuz after I part this C/sea then I lift up the staff
I feel Dre
Cuz I would’ve still been on Death Row if I let my division subtract his ass
But instead of the camera
I put the beats on him on the low so I could get back to stash
That’s how I got Shady after Math
Whats worse than a nigga that gets personal with you and turn on a nigga
These fuckers in the culture got me on fire like Ferguson, nigga
And I don’t mean the pigs when they did it
But I take this job cuz this only time
I could kill a nigga in front of the world and get away with it

Round 3
Daylyt

[Verse 3: Daylyt]

That’s what’s wrong with these stupid out-of-state niggas
Come to Cali and be lost’n
You dumb ass nigga, ain’t no 60’s up in Carson!
As the bottom stare, this is a step down to the king
We can actually see who the peasant, Jones
Don’t be mad cuz you got wrapped in a box, nigga
Just be happy to be in my presence (presents)
They said you was gifted when you battled Jin
All that mouth drilling and that’s what got ya feelings up
But the difference is you Clifford
The world consider you a big dog, but technically you still a pup
But guess what big dog?
You done stumbled in a puddle of defeat
I peeped ya two paws wet
You better get ready for the Chevy cuz, I’m who the crew call vets
But it’s magnificent, this where you get left frozen pussy
Cold twat, you know me, my M.O., G (Emoji)
One small sign could say a whole lot
But you notice first round I ain’t get personal
Second round I ain’t get personal, third round we get personal
This where it get gory bro
In my Mook voice, everybody wanna know so here’s how the story go
Lush One called me, I was getting some head…
He said we got a battle for you & it might involve you getting some bread
I said “Who is he?” he said “Serius” I said “Serious? This nigga dead!”
First thing I did was push P. Diddy off of the bed
On some real nigga G shit I used to think you was a cold killa
And everything changed right after the “wooo!” nigga
You told me verbatimly, before the Math battle, you like to squabble
30 minutes into the Math battle ya chin got hit, you like to wobble
I seen this cat walk then I seen Math run way, you like a model
If it was me he would’ve got a shell over that beef, you like the taco
He would’ve got chipped for the cheese, you like the nacho
The best luck for another stretch truck, you like a Tahoe
I would’ve lined up a round for this nigga, you like a waffle
Then put that same round next to the chicken, you like the Roscoe’s
I would’ve left his face all out of place, you like Picasso
Then I let it burn in here, you like a hot comb
Then I let it ring in the middle of ya face, you like 2Pac nose
Another serious nigga getting ripped in the middle of the club, you like Belasco's
But it’s a difference between Cali niggas and y’all niggas
When we get hit we rally niggas, John Sally niggas
Backshot, Ricky in the alley niggas
But the difference between us is these niggas walk up to a person and say
“If you need some help, I got ya”
A Cali nigga walk up to you like “aye homie you need some help?”
*Blocka! Blocka!*
But a raz on him, it’s time to spaz on him
Nigga I’m done with this nigga I’m bout to let the homie spaz on him
Vicious get him cuz…

Dre Vishiss:

[I took the sweet potato on the cannon and made can yams
Two burners, Jean and Claude, kicking out the Van, Damn
If I clap, turn victims into snacks when it boom boom and blam blam
Cuz all my bullets all they do is zoom zoom and wam wam nigga
If I clutch that heater it ain’t a buzzer beater
I should’ve been on Ether too so I’ma Ether you
Have you hiding from 2 5’s like niggas was playing peek-a-boo
Right here where these people be leaving you, I’ll be leaving you
I’m a motherfuckin monster with stripes, you’ll get ya Beetlejuice]

Beatz Gatlin:

[I don’t wanna hear no bars
About nobody from my la familia you familiar with
Daylyt is Daylyt, that’s that nigga
I’ll slap niggas and that’s facts, anybody could get familiar with]

SERIUS JONES

See y’all be knowing Jones, b
I accept a whole fee with my palms high like a coconut tree
Ironic a nigga reppin purple is now sour and wanna get higher
While trying to smoke the OG
But see my shots swisher, my speech finish like I’m Dutch
I could have ya entourage tubed up, but I roll old school
I’d rather hit the lick and rip off the paper after I empty ya guts
Good morning, scope in ya mouth, clear out a distance
That gun smoke aroma it’ll choke ya, air out the witness
I move forest, ya Inglewood could share my statistics
Ya OG while you was on ya side kicking booboos
I was on my grizzly; I put Smokey The Bear out of business
Y’all probably got some fire that been burned by you
Cuz I had a grow house in LA with some nerds I knew
He thought the Mob was Goodie he tried “peeking in the window”
Trying to see the herb I grew
I put the Eagle in Quill’s face just so I could give him a bird’s eye view
I played with toys since a boy, my Armstrong so I stretch more
I Chutes with Ladders, if the chips fall where they may then I connect four
I heard Bobby Johnson is like South Central
They make it whisper when they throw lead
So deuce deuce, pull out the stash
Take out the nose and let you meet Mr. Potato Head
You don’t want ya kid to be an orphan, do you?
Look at me king, I’m talking to you
Ya name’s Day right? Alright
You thinking ya son/sun will be most important to you
You know he gon Google ya legacy one day
The banana splits was sweet enough
But the doo doo brown syrup
That’s gon be the cherry on top for ya son day (Sundae)
See you know what, I get it, you don’t care about being wealthy
You got ya whole clique in here
You getting embarrassed lookin crazy and y’all taking selfies
I’m doing you greasy and I’ma rub it in cuz you flaky as goat skin
I get the itch, ankle strap, where I keep that cal of mine? Low shin (calamine lotion)
Bump me? And I grab what I wear on my pants leg
Show you I’m a Patriot when I start airing, her and Diz (Aaron Hernandez)
See you can’t beat me with Batman or Spawn’s powers
This god hour, ya soft coward bars sound like talking flowers on powder
Talk louder, walk louder, spark wilder
Your raps Al Qaida
Cuz ya fly is too plain to blow up, lost towers
I rep the east but we respect the west where I’m from
They ask me do they got bars, I say “bar-none” Is there comp? Tons (Compton)
But if you ain’t from neighborhoods and you riding in the city
Stay in ya car, son (Carson)
My East Los Vatos don’t play
Ya bitch get gangbanged and sexed in the Chola way
Brought her to my homes, I said “Jones, no you don’t have to pay
Cuz see ma, she audele
See it's some freaks you can bank on
That leave you down by the riverside when they blast the nina
Even Ms. Howard said she’d be a freak until the Day but this is
Past Adina/Pasedena
See I mack until I’m down on my last with 10 toes
In the Bay with a bag of pills, it’s look like a sac of mentos (Sacremento)
See I heard niggas from Watts was live wires
And they let them guns blow proudly
But he was talking about letting the pounds go on camera
But he was quiet in New York, I said maybe you’re from Humble County
See you play a lot of gun games but this ain’t Halo kid
Cuz I turn this to City Of God, let that metal ring over ya head
Send you to where ya lost angel is (Los Angeles)
My clip full these niggas been scared
It’s like a fat bitch with a waist trainer
So what it’s hanging out the bottom
I’m still gon squeeze everything in here
I’ll blow out Kevin’s heart  for the right price nigga
Aye Daylyt, you ever go ‘night night’ nigga?
Matter fact niggas sleep when you on, you ain’t Day, you night Lyt nigga
You don’t even like dark skin niggas, you homo, you like light niggas
Aight man you know what, fuck it I’m done son

Over jungle sound effects, the CAMERA is low, moving through brush from the POV of a stalking animal. As the brush parts, revealing Wall Street and the New York Stock Exchange, we HEAR the resonant voice of GENE HACKMAN.

GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) The world of investing can be a jungle.

1A	WE SEE a charging, snorting BULL.	1A

GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Bulls.

1B	WE SEE a ferocious, growling BEAR.	1B
GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Bears. Danger at every turn.

Pretentious CLASSICAL MUSIC kicks in.

GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) That’s why we at Stratton Oakmont pride ourselves on being the best.

1C-1D	VARIOUS SHOTS -- a conservative young MAN reviews a stock 1C-1D portfolio with a wealthy older COUPLE; a smiling young
WOMAN sits before a computer talking into a headset.

GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Trained professionals to guide you through the financial wilderness.

1E	WE SEE the Stratton “team” - an ethnically diverse group	1E of ACTORS with their handsome, grey-templed “CHAIRMAN”.

GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Stratton Oakmont. Stability. Integrity. Pride.

1F	WE SEE a shot of the black glass Stratton Building, and:	1F


2	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (FEB ‘95)	2

Absolute bedlam. 300 drunken STOCKBROKERS, most in their early 20s, chant wildly as JORDAN BELFORT, handsome, 30, stands beside a DWARF dressed in tights, cape & helmet.

JORDAN
Twenty five grand to the first cocksucker to nail a bullseye!

The “bullseye” is a large dollar sign in the middle of a giant velcro “dartboard”.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	2.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Watch and learn, people!

The Brokers go apeshit as Jordan grabs the Dwarf by his pants and collar. In the Crowd, cash flies as side bets are made. Jordan winds up, aims for the “dartboard”.

JORDAN (CONT’D) One. Two. Throw!!

The Brokers cheer, and as the screaming Dwarf takes flight, hurtling toward camera, we FREEZE FRAME:

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
My name is Jordan Belfort. No, not	* him, me. I’m a former member of	* the middle class raised by two
accountants in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.


3-3B	A SERIES OF POLAROIDS -- (1969)	3*-3B

Jordan, 7, smiles as he poses behind a lemonade stand, his parents Max and Leah behind him; Jordan, 13, stands holding a styrofoam cooler, selling ices on the beach; Jordan, 18, smiles as he holds an Amway sales brochure.

JORDAN (V.O.) The year I turned 26, I made 49 million dollars as the head of my own brokerage firm--


4	EXT. LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY - DAY (FEB ‘95)	4

A CHERRY RED Ferrari Testarossa ZOOMS down the L.I.E.

JORDAN (V.O.) --which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.
The Ferrari weaves in and out of traffic.

JORDAN (V.O.) Hey, my Ferrari was white, like Don Johnson’s in Miami Vice.

We see the same Ferrari, now in WHITE, as it zooms away, a BLONDE head bobbing up and down in Jordan’s lap.


5	EXT. LONG ISLAND’S NORTH SHORE - DAY (FEB ‘95)	5

A twin-engine Bell Jet helicopter descends over a huge mansion, with sparkling pool, tennis court and waterfall.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	3.


JORDAN (V.O.) See that humongous estate down there? That’s my house.


6	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	6

We see NAOMI, 24, blonde and gorgeous, a living wet dream in LaPerla lingerie.

JORDAN (V.O.)
My wife, Naomi, the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, a former model and Miller Lite girl.

Naomi licks her lips; she’s incredibly, painfully hot.

JORDAN (V.O.) Yeah, she was the one blowing me in the Ferrari, so put your dick back in your pants.

Over the following, WE SEE a quick


7-7C	SERIES OF SHOTS	7-7C

All taken from TV; a mansion from Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous; wealthy PEOPLE applauding at a polo match; a yacht sailing crystal blue seas; Robert Wagner and
Stephanie Powers toasting with champagne on Hart to Hart.

JORDAN (V.O.)
In addition to Naomi and my two perfect kids, I own a mansion, private jet, six cars, three horses, two vacation homes and a 170 foot yacht.


8	INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT (FEB ‘95)	8

Sweaty, wild-eyed and naked, Jordan fucks an HISPANIC HOOKER from behind.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I also gamble like a degenerate, drink like a fish, fuck hookers maybe five times a week and have three different Federal agencies looking to indict me.

He dismounts, snorts some coke through a straw, then uses it to blow some into her asshole.

JORDAN (V.O.) Oh yeah, and I love drugs.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	4.


Jordan looks up suddenly, paranoid, as if he’s hearing voices.


9	INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT (FEB ‘95)	9

Jordan, drooling and stoned out of his skull, wears a rumpled custom-made business suit as he mans a set of controls next to his frantic co-pilot, CAPTAIN DAVE.


Pull up! crash!!
CAPTAIN DAVE Jesus! We’re gonna

Jordan’s head bobs as he pulls back on the stick.
The helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering 30 feet above a huge mansion. Down below, through Jordan’s hazy, DOUBLE VISIONED POV, we see a sparkling pool, tennis court and waterfall.

JORDAN (V.O.) Check this out -- despite my completely fucked-up state, I could fly straight while still seeing two of everything.

He closes one eye; his POV sharpens. Putting pressure on the stick, the helicopter descends slowly over the driving range... then LURCHES and SLAMS to the ground.

JORDAN (to Captain Dave)
Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay, buddy.


10	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - FRONT DOOR - DAY (FEB ‘95)	10

Morning. Sober now, impeccable in suit and tie, Jordan heads for the door holding a glass of orange juice.

JORDAN (V.O.) Yes, on a daily basis I take enough drugs to sedate greater Long Island.


11	EXT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - CONTINUOUS (FEB ‘95)	11

He pops two white pills, swigs some juice, then speaks
directly to the camera as he heads for a waiting limo.

JORDAN
I take Quaaludes for my back, fifteen to twenty a day.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	5.

JORDAN (CONT'D) I use Xanax to stay focused, ambien to sleep, pot to mellow out, cocaine to wake up and morphine because it’s awesome.


12	EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - LONG ISLAND - DAY (FEB ‘95)	12

The limo pulls up to the black glass office building. Jordan gets out, heads inside through a back door.

JORDAN
But of all the drugs under God’s blue heaven, there’s one that’s my absolute favorite.


13	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY (FEB ‘95) 13

Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. With the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk. As he peels a crisp $100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad, rolls it up:

JORDAN
Enough of this shit’ll make you invincible, able to conquer the world and eviscerate your enemies.

He SNARFS up the line, gestures to the cocaine.

JORDAN (CONT’D) I’m not talking about this. I’m talking about this.
(Jordan unfurls the $100 with a SNAP)
Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive.

He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner, where it comes to rest with two dozen others. Over his back as we TRACK HIM out of his office toward what sounds like the ROAR of a mob--

JORDAN (V.O.) Money doesn’t just buy you a
better life -- better food, better cars, better pussy -- it also makes you a better person. You can give generously to the church of your choice or the political party. You can save the fucking spotted owl with money.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	6.


14	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (FEB ‘95)	14

Arms akimbo, Jordan stands above the bullpen, a huge open space with tightly packed rows of maple colored desks.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But most of all, in any country in the world, money can buy you love. Fuck the Beatles.

His 300 BROKERS, mostly young men with their jackets off, scream wildly. They worship him.

JORDAN (V.O.) With that in mind, at the tender age of 22, after marrying my girlfriend Teresa--


14A	SCENES 14A - 18 OMITTED	14A


19	EXT. WALL STREET - DAY (MAY ‘87)	19

An express bus pull up -- its sign reads “Wall Street”....

JORDAN (V.O.)
--I headed to the only place that befit my high-minded ambitions...

Jordan emerges, kisses TERESA goodbye, then joins a sea of Commuters heading to work.

JERRY FOGEL (PRE-LAP) You are lower than fucking pond scum.


20	INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY (MAY ‘87)	20

Computers, telephones everywhere. At their desks, 45 shirt-sleeved BROKERS read their Wall St. Journals, readying for war. Like an eager puppy, Jordan follows broker JERRY FOGEL, 30, thick-lipped and bow-tied...

JERRY FOGEL You got a problem with that?
(reads name tag) Jordan?

JORDAN Nope. No problem at all.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	7.


JERRY FOGEL Your job is ‘connector’, which
means you'll be dialing the phone over 500 times a day, trying to ‘connect’ me with business owners. And till you pass your Series 7, that’s all you’ll be doing. Sit.

Jordan takes a seat at the desk next to Fogel’s.

JERRY FOGEL (CONT’D) Just so you know, last year I made over 300k and the other guy you'll be working for made a million.

JORDAN (V.O.)
A million dollars? I could only imagine what a douchebag that guy must be.

A manicured hand lands on Jordan’s shoulder. It’s MARK HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.

MARK HANNA Jordan? Mark Hanna.
(re: Fogel)
Good, you’ve met Jerry. One of the smartest guys in the office. Who’s ever sucked a dog’s cock out of loneliness.

Fogel’s smile turns to a frown. He hands Jordan a stack of 3x5 index cards.

JERRY FOGEL Smile and dial. And don’t pick your fucking head up till one.

MARK HANNA
Don’t mind Jerry, his father raped him as a child. Besides, I'm senior broker here, he's a worthless piker. I heard you pitched stock at your job interview.

JORDAN
Had to do something to stand out.

MARK HANNA
I fuckin’ love that! Let’s grab lunch later. Windows good with you?

JORDAN Great. Yeah.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	8.


Hanna gives him a wink, looks at the clock on the giant electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.

MARK HANNA Let’s fuck!!

RING!!! Absolute pandemonium at the BELL signalling the opening of the stock market. Feet fly off desks; Brokers and their Connectors dial phones like mad. The CAMERA PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR.

BROKER #1 (to Broker #2)
Miniscribe's a fuckin’ steal! Thirty eight bucks a share!

MARK HANNA (into headset)
Your broker in West Virginia? What are you buying, a coal mine? It's the 80s, the game is high-tech.

BROKER #2 (to Broker #3)
Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!

JORDAN (V.O.)
You want to know what money sounds like? Visit a trading floor on Wall Street. Fuck this, shit that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I couldn’t believe how these guys talked to each other--

Fogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen. He covers his mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.

JERRY FOGEL Dial the cocksucking phone!

Jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.

JORDAN (V.O.) I was hooked within seconds.

Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a “buy” ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.

JORDAN (V.O.)
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and we’re suddenly--
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	9.


21	INT. WINDOWS ON THE WORLD - DAY (MAY ‘87)	21

CLOSE ON a COKE SPOON whose contents disappear up a nostril. PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

The lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the city. At a corner table, a paranoid Jordan looks around as Hanna does another bump of coke. None of the other DINERS seem to notice or care.

MARK HANNA (offering the spoon)
Got enough for one more? Tootski?

JORDAN No. Thanks though.

Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the tuxedoed Maitre’D, approaches.

HECTOR
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?

Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan notices.

MARK HANNA Here’s the game plan, Hector. Bring us two Absolut Martinis
straight up. Precisely seven and a half minutes after you deliver those you’ll bring two more, then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out.

HECTOR
An excellent strategy, sir.

JORDAN Actually, I’m good with 7-Up.

Jordan might as well have farted at the table.

MARK HANNA
First day on Wall Street, Hector. Give him time.
(Hector offers menus) No thanks, I’m not eating.

Hector heads off.

JORDAN
You can get high during the day and still function?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	10.


MARK HANNA
High is the only way to do this fucking job. Guy who coined the term “three-martini lunch” was a woman. Cocaine and hookers, my friend, the keys to success.

Jordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding.

JORDAN
I gotta say, I’m really excited about being part of your team. I wanna do all I can for our clients and --

MARK HANNA (reciting an ad)
“Here at L.F. Rothschild, our clients aren’t just important, they’re family.” Just as long as we get our taste first. Remember something, Jordan, your top priority in this job: make us money. If the clients get rich along the way, bully for them. Got a girlfriend?

JORDAN Wife. She cuts hair.

Mark swallows a comment about that. Gets to business.

MARK HANNA
OK, first rule of Wall Street. Nobody -- and I don’t care if you’re Warren Buffet or Jimmy Buffet -- nobody knows if a stock’s going up, down or fucking sideways, least of all stock brokers. But we have to pretend we know. Make sure you stay relaxed. Nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they haven’t gotten laid in a month. Take breaks when you feel stressed, jerk off if you can. You like jerking off, right?

JORDAN Well... sure.

MARK HANNA
Good, jerking off is key. And I highly recommend cocaine, which will make you dial faster, which is good for me. Churn ‘em and burn ‘em, baby.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	11.


A BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks him. Then, discreetly as possible, Mark removes a fresh vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort. Jordan realizes: that’s why he palmed the maitre d’ $100.

JORDAN (V.O.)
For the next six months I learned the ways of Wall Street.


22	INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT (OCT ‘87)	22

As STRIPPERS grind in b.g, Jordan parties with Mark Hanna and dozens of BROKERS and TRAINEES. Jordan sips a martini and studies Mark Hanna, hitting on a STRIPPER.

JORDAN (V.O.) That fall I passed my Series 7. Finally it was here.


23	INT. ROTHSCHILD BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY (OCT ‘87)	23

Briefcase in hand, Jordan boards the elevator with a dozen other BROKERS.

JORDAN (V.O.)
My first day as a stockbroker, a future Master of the Universe.

And as the doors close, on screen WE SEE:

OCTOBER 19th, 1987


24	INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY (OCT ‘87)	24

Total chaos. Jordan dials the phone as all around him Brokers panic, screaming into headsets.

JORDAN (V.O.) They called it Black Monday.
By four p.m. the market was down 508 points, the biggest one-day drop since the crash of ‘29.

4 p.m. The closing bell RINGS; the entire place goes silent. Brokers look at each other, stunned.

MARK HANNA Holy. Fucking. Shit.

And as the Brokers start commiserating with each other...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	12.


JORDAN (V.O.) L.F. Rothschild, a company that had been in business since 1883, closed its doors within a month.


25	INT. JORDAN & TERESA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (DEC ‘87)	25

Jordan sits at the table perusing the Times classifieds. Teresa approaches with two coffees. Sits next to him.

TERESA
So I’ll take an extra shift, don’t worry about it.

JORDAN
You work too much as it is.

TERESA
We could pawn my engagement ring.

JORDAN
We’re not pawning anything. I’m gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.

TERESA
You know that doesn’t matter, right?

He smiles, kisses her. Together, they peruse the ads.

JORDAN (points to an ad)
“Nobody Beats the Wiz”. I could be a stock boy.

TERESA You’re a stock broker.

JORDAN
No one’s hiring brokers right now, sweetie.

They go back to the ads. After a few beats, she points--

TERESA This place is.


26	EXT. STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - LONG ISLAND - DAY (DEC ‘87) 26

In a suit, Jordan emerges from an ‘85 Datsun. He looks around confused, heads toward an unmarked storefront.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	13.


27	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - DAY (DEC ‘87)	27

The antithesis of L.F. Rothschild, with cheap furniture and a dozen misfit “BROKERS” giving loud, obnoxious sales pitches. Jordan enters, a modern man among cave people. DWAYNE, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.

JORDAN
I’m looking for Investor’s Center?

DWAYNE That’s us, hey. Dwayne.

JORDAN
(as they shake hands) Jordan Belfort, I called earlier. I was a broker with Rothschild.

Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat. Nearby, a Broker in ratty Keds, TOBY WELCH, is screaming into his phone.

TOBY WELCH
I’m tellin’ you, this stock is goin’ up!... Cause I know, okay?!... I have inside information!

Jordan looks at him, appalled at what he’s hearing.

JORDAN Where are your quotrons?

DWAYNE
No quotrons, we sell off the pink sheets -- penny stocks.

Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are literally pink. He explains as Jordan flips the pages:

DWAYNE (CONT’D) Company don’t have enough capital to be listed on NASDAQ, their shares trade here.
(points to the book)
Like these guys, Aerotyne? They make radar detectors out of a garage in Dubuque.

JORDAN
Six cents a share? Who buys this crap?

DWAYNE Schmucks mostly. Mailmen,
plumbers, people thinking they can get rich quick. They answer our ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	14.


JORDAN
The spread on these is huge.

DWAYNE
So’s your commission, that’s the point. Blue chips stocks you get what, one percent? Pink sheets are fifty.

JORDAN
Wait a second. You’re telling me if I sell two thousand dollars worth of stock, my commission is a thousand bucks?

DWAYNE Technically, yeah, but not even the biggest schmuck buys two thousand dollars of this shit.


28	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY (DEC ’87)	28

As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then:

JORDAN (into phone)
Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan Belfort with Investor’s Center in New York City. You recently responded to one of our ads...

A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.

JORDAN (CONT’D) The reason I’m calling is that an extremely exciting investment
opportunity crossed my desk today. Typically our firm recommends no more than five stocks per year: this is one of them...

A few more Brokers look over...

JORDAN (CONT'D) Aerotyne International is a cutting edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of radar equipment...

LATER. Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	15.


JORDAN (CONT’D) -- so if Aerotyne’s shares rise to only a dollar -- and our
research indicates they could go much, much higher -- your profit on a mere three thousand dollar investment would be upwards of fifty thousand... That’s right, you could pay off your mortgage.

Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:

JORDAN (CONT’D) Four thousand dollars, will that be check or money order?... Thank you, sir.

Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a “buy” ticket.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) Just like that I made two grand.
The other guys looked at me like I’d just discovered fire.

Toby Welch and the other cave-Brokers stare at him.

TOBY WELCH How’d you fuckin’ do that?


29	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - (ANOTHER) DAY (FEB ‘88)	29

Jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused.

JORDAN
It’s a rock-solid company, sir, it’s the next Microsoft...
Six thousand. Terrific.

As Jordan continues talking, wrapping up the sale...

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) Though I knew I was selling
garbage, within twelve weeks I was making a fortune.

And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...

JORDAN (V.O.) And as a wise man once told me, my only responsibility was to put meat on the table.

CLOSE ON a 1988 Jaguar, parked outside a diner...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	16.


30	INT. KACANDES DINER - BAYSIDE - DAY (JUN ‘88)	30

Wearing a suit, Jordan sits in a booth reading the Wall Street Journal as a WAITRESS serves the food. DONNIE AZOFF, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright white teeth approaches from the takeout counter.

DONNIE That your Jag in the lot?


Yeah.


Nice ride.
JORDAN


DONNIE Donnie Azoff.

JORDAN Jordan Belfort.

DONNIE
I’ve seen it around. We live in the same building. Twelfth floor?
(Jordan nods) What do you do, bro?

JORDAN Stock broker.

DONNIE
Kids furniture, me and my brother-in-law. Making any money?

JORDAN Seventy grand last month.

DONNIE
Get the fuck out. You made seventy grand in one month.

JORDAN Seventy two actually.

Donnie studies him, isn’t sure if he’s full of shit.

DONNIE
Tell you what. You show me a pay stub with $72,000 on it, I’m quitting my job right now and coming to work with you.

As Jordan retrieves his briefcase to find a paystub --	*

30B	As Jordan hands Donnie his paystub and sure enough, it’s	*30B north of seventy-two k.	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	17.


DONNIE (CONT’D)	* Holy shit.

Jordan watches as Donnie crosses to a pay phone and dials.

JORDAN (V.O.) And he did quit his job, which I thought was a little weird. I mean I had just met this fucking guy.

A few beats, then into phone:

DONNIE
Yo Paulie, it’s Donnie... Yeah, listen, I quit.

Jordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation...

JORDAN (V.O.) There were other things about him
too, like his phosphorescent white teeth and the fact that he wore horn rims with clear lenses to look more Waspy. He also married his first cousin --

31	SCENE 31 OMITTED	31


32	INT. BAR - DAY (JUN ‘88)	*32

Jordan sits in mid-conversation with Donnie over beers.

DONNIE
No problem, if we have a kid who’s a retard, we’ll just leave it on the steps of some institution.

And as they continue drinking...

JORDAN (V.O.)
He was also a closet drug fiend. I’d known him less than a week before he talked me into smoking crack.


33	EXT. BACK OF BAR - DAY (JUN ‘88)	*33

Jordan and Donnie get high. Donnie holds a flame under a crack pipe.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	18.


JORDAN (V.O.)
The weird thing was when he’d do crack, his face would contort into this bizarre, frozen mask like the Phantom of the Opera.

Donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his facial muscles contort, locking up like a stroke victim. After a few beats, he hands the pipe to Jordan.

DONNIE You now, take a hit!

Jordan takes a deep hit and holds it. A beat, then:

JORDAN Omigod, I fuckin’ love you!!

JORDAN (V.O.) I knew I had to make him my partner.


34	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - DAY (SEP ‘88)	34

Jordan looks on as Donnie works the phone like a madman.

JORDAN (V.O.) Which turned out to be a great move - Donnie was a fast learner who transitioned into the penny stock business quickly.


35	EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP - DAY (SEP ‘88)	35

Jordan and Donnie pull up to a defunct auto body shop, which has a “For Lease” sign in the window.

JORDAN (V.O.)
So within months we started our own firm out of an abandoned auto body shop.


36	INT. KACANDES DINER - DAY (OCT ‘88)	36

Jordan sits with CHESTER MING, ROBBIE FEINBERG, ALDEN KUPFERBERG (”SEA OTTER”) and BRAD, muscular and bald, with a Fu Manchu mustache.

JORDAN (V.O.) In addition to Donnie, I also
recruited my friends Sea Otter,	* Chester and Robbie, who were at	* the time all middling pot dealers.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	19.


As a WAITRESS serves cheeseburgers:

JORDAN
--see everyone wants to get rich, so you’re already half way there by the time the call starts.

SEA OTTER
I sold weed once to this Amish dude, had one of those beards with no mustache?

ROBBIE FEINBERG So?

SEA OTTER
He only wanted to make furniture.

CHESTER MING What’s that got to do with anything?

SEA OTTER
He just said everyone wants to get rich.

ROBBIE FEINBERG (to Jordan)
That’s true, you did.

SEA OTTER Buddhists too, they don’t give a shit about money either.

CHESTER MING
Man I could sell weed to anybody, get a convent full of nuns fucking wasted.

And as Brad looks at Jordan and shakes his head:


37	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN	37 (OCT ‘88)

We see the above guys working the phones.

JORDAN (V.O.) Brad, the guy I really wanted,
took a pass, since he’d become the Quaalude king of Bayside.


38	EXT. BRAD’S HOUSE - BACKYARD GYM - DAY (OCT ‘88)	38

Bare-chested, wearing kung fu pants, Brad sells ludes to a couple of HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.

JORDAN (V.O.) They were absolute morons, my
friends, but like I always said--


39	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN - DAY	39 (OCT ‘88)

Jordan emerges from his office into the garage area
(the bullpen), looking on as Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Sea Otter and four other BROKERS (now including RUGRAT and Toby) make sales calls from the cheap desks.

JORDAN (V.O.) Give me them young, hungry and stupid and in no time I’ll make them rich.


40	EXT. MARINA - LONG ISLAND - SUNSET (MAY ‘89)	40

On lounge chairs at the edge of a dock, bottle of wine nearby, Jordan sits with Teresa. He smiles as she opens a jewelry case -- inside is a diamond tennis bracelet.

TERESA Omigod. Jordan.

JORDAN You like it?

TERESA It’s beautiful.

Jordan helps her try it on. She smiles, but he detects a wave of... something.

JORDAN
They’re small, I know, but the stones are really high quality.

TERESA No, no. I love it.


Then what?

They sit in silence.
JORDAN


Finally:

TERESA
I don’t know, it’s just -- these stocks, these crappy companies.

JORDAN
In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	21.


TERESA
Why can’t you be legitimate now?

JORDAN It’s not illegal, Teresa,
technically. I mean they’re real stocks, they’re just...

TERESA
Never gonna make anybody money. (a few beats; then)
Wouldn’t you feel better selling this junk to rich people, who can afford to lose the money at least?

JORDAN
Rich people don’t buy penny stocks.

TERESA Why not?

And on Jordan’s look:

JORDAN (V.O.) Because they’re too smart, that’s why not.


41	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - DAY (AUG ‘89)	41

CLOSE ON Jordan, brow furrowing as his wheels turn.

JORDAN (V.O.) I mean what person of any

Well, you can probably figure that out for yourself.


47	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT	47 (MAR ‘90)

The camera PUSHES IN on Jordan as he stands before a large dry erase board.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But what if they didn’t sound like jerk-offs? What if I took this bunch of nincompoops and molded them in my own image? I reinvented the company, gave it a new image, a new name. Something patrician, blue-blooded, something that reeked of tradition and anti-semitism.

And as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs--

JORDAN Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton
Oakmont. The clients we’ve gone after in the past -- they’re done. We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of Americans. The methods we’ve used -- over. Loud, obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	23.

JORDAN (CONT'D)
In military terms it’s like carpet-bombing -- noisy, menacing and only marginally effective. As Stratton brokers you will be laser-guided smart-bombs aimed at high-priority targets. You will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks -- then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets, where the real money is. Now the key to every sale is this:

Jordan writes the word “URGENCY” on the board.

JORDAN (CONT’D)
No one buys stock unless he thinks it’s going up and going up now. You must convince your client to buy before the takeover happens, before the lawsuit is settled, before the patent is granted.
If he says I’ll think about it and call you back, it’s over, you’re dead! No one calls back! So you have to create urgency --


48	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	48

Another day. With Stratton Oakmont signage visible in the b.g., Jordan is on speakerphone with a potential CLIENT, the other Brokers listening in.

JORDAN
--and once Kodak settles the lawsuit, institutions will be permitted to buy their shares in large blocks again. And when that happens, which is any day now, what do you think will happen to the price of Kodak stock?

CLIENT (O.S.) It’ll go up?

JORDAN
Exactly. Which is why you should pick up 5000 shares today, a $200,000 investment.


49	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT	49

Jordan stands addressing his Brokers.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	24.


JORDAN
Then you lower your voice.

Jordan pitches the client, his voice lowered.

JORDAN
Believe me, sir, you will not be sorry.


51	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT	51

Jordan stands before the Brokers.

JORDAN
Then you wait. Whoever speaks first loses. At this point, where are we in the sale? Chester?

CHESTER MING About to close?

JORDAN
No, you sweet and sour douchebag! We’re at the beginning of the beginning! This is where the sale starts. You as a salesman are almost hoping he says no so you can finally do your fucking job!


52	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	52

Jordan sits at the phone, waiting for a response.

CLIENT (O.S.)
I don’t know, I don’t think so.


53	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT	53

Jordan stands before the Brokers.

JORDAN
He doesn’t know, he needs to think, he’s gotta ask his wife! The fact is it doesn’t matter what the fuck he says! If he’s already agreed that the stock’s going up, then the only real objection he has at this point is he doesn’t trust you! And he shouldn’t trust you, you’re a fucking salesman! So what do you say?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	25.


54	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	54

Donnie talks on the phone to a Client.

DONNIE
Let me ask you this, sir -- had I been your broker for the past three to four years and made you money on a consistent basis, you probably wouldn’t say you need to think about it, you’d probably say pick me up three or four thousand shares, am I right?

CLIENT #2 (O.S.) Maybe.


55	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	55 (APR ‘90)

The place is crowded; now 20 Brokers make up the sales force. Sea Otter pitches a client.

SEA OTTER
Wait a second. You mean to tell me if I put you in Union Carbide at 7 and took you out at 32--


56	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	56 (MAY ‘90)

More Brokers still - now there’s 45.

CHESTER MING

New offices now, a real brokerage firm. The bullpen is large, with 75 Brokers at polished maple desks, sitting before computers talking into headsets.

JORDAN Everybody have a good week?

Applause; war whoops.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	28.


JORDAN (CONT’D) I’d like to read you something.
(reads spread sheet) Month end, March 1991! $28.7
million in gross commissions - all	* in Stratton issues. Not bad for	* penny stocks, huh boys? Not bad	* for dumpin’ penny stocks.	*

The place goes WILD with applause.

JORDAN (CONT’D)
And to celebrate with a weekly act of debauchery, I have offered our lovely sales assistant Danielle
Harrison ten thousand dollars to	* have her head shaved!

Jordan motions to DANIELLE HARRISON, 19, pretty, sitting	* in a chair nearby. Behind her, Rugrat uses clippers to
shave her thick brown mane. The place goes nuts.

JORDAN (CONT’D) FYI, Danielle tells me she’s using the money for breast implants! Is this a great company or what?!!

More wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen to Donnie. We hear the opening strains of “Stars & Stripes Forever” as he opens the door to a

COLLEGE MARCHING BAND

dressed in underwear and hats. The music continues as somersaulting GYMNASTS and BATON-TWIRLERS bring up the rear. As they march through the bullpen to cheers--

FROM THE KITCHEN -- two dozen TUXEDO-CLAD WAITERS emerge carrying trays of champagne and hors d’oeuvres. The music continues as two dozen STRIPPERS bolt in, gyrating among the BROKERS. As Jordan surveys the insanity:

JORDAN (V.O.) Word spread throughout Wall

A gorgeous place; city views. As Teresa sits nearby, a distraught Jordan paces, holding the copy of Forbes.

JORDAN

“The Wolf of Wall Street”.

TERESA
(on the bright side) Your hair looks good.

JORDAN
“Jordan Belfort, a twisted version of Robin Hood who takes from the rich and gives to himself and his merry band of brokers”.

TERESA There’s no such thing as bad publicity, sweetie.


70	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT II - BULLPEN - LATER THAT DAY	70

Bustling with activity. Jordan enters, crosses toward his office. Off to the side of the bullpen, he notices three dozen YOUNG MEN in business suits. He approaches his assistant JANET, 20s, dressed all in black.

JORDAN The hell’s all this?

JANET
The Forbes article. They’re applying for jobs.

They spot Jordan, start clamoring, waving their resumes.

JOB APPLICANTS Mr. Belfort! Over here! Sir!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	30.


JORDAN (V.O.) Forbes had made me a superstar. Every day dozens of money-crazed kids beat a path to my door with resumes they hadn’t even bothered to spellcheck.

Jordan crosses through the packed bullpen, where 150 BROKERS, no older than 22, are crammed elbow to elbow talking into phones. Some have pets, which they tend to while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a chimp. Others are getting shoulder rubs by Masseuses or being fitted for suits by a TAILOR. Over the above:

JORDAN (V.O.)
If we hired ‘em, they dropped out of college overnight and blew whatever allowance they had on a new suit from our in-house tailor. The median age of our brokerage couldn’t get served in the bar down the street.


71	INT. FBI BREAK ROOM - DAY (OCT ‘91)	71

CLOSE ON two BROKERS wrestling while others cheer them on. PULL BACK to reveal the place from the opening. 300 young Brokers and their hot ASSISTANTS work the phones.

JORDAN (V.O.) Within months, we doubled in size, moved to even bigger offices.

Two other Brokers pump themselves up, chest-bumping and screaming like football players.

JORDAN (V.O.)
It was a madhouse, a greed-fest, with equal parts cocaine, testosterone and body fluids.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	31.


73	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - MEN’S ROOM - DAY (MAR ‘92)	73

In a stall, two Brokers snort coke, while another Broker fucks a Sales Assistant perched on the sink.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I had to declare the office a fuck-free zone between the hours of 9 and 7, but even that didn’t help.

Taped to the mirror we see a MEMO -- inside a red circle, two anatomically correct stick figures fuck doggy-style, a red line slashing through them.

JORDAN (V.O.) Actually the madness started on our very first day, when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner, christened the elevator by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant.

Two dozen Brokers cheer, watching through the rising glass elevator as BEN JENNER, 25, gets a blowjob from a

The phone RINGS.

MAX
Who the hell has the goddamn gall to call this house on a Tuesday evening! Goddammit!

JORDAN (V.O.)
But then the weirdest thing would happen. Though he’d never been near England, he’d pick up the phone and affect an ever-so-slight British accent.

Greatly agitated, Max stomps toward the phone.

JORDAN (V.O.)
This was his other persona -- the super polite, ever-gracious Sir Max.

MAX (into phone)
Hello?... Yes, Gene, right-eo. Good-good then... Cheerio.

JORDAN Get some tranq darts.

DONNIE
A little straitjacket.	*

JORDAN	* What’s the liability on something	* like this?

RUGRAT	* That's a whole different thing. I	* can get on the phone with some	* people. I can talk to the	* insurance company and tell them	* exactly what we're going to do.	* But I think we go back to the same	* plan - loophole - if we don't	* really consider them people I	* think we are in the clear.	*

DONNIE	* I think we should keep one in the	* office because I think they’re	* good luck.	*

JORDAN	* Treat it like the fuckin' thing it	* is. He's coming in. We're paying	* him for something. Treat him with	* respect. And you just shake his	* hand like you don't even think	* anything's wrong.	*

DONNIE	* You just look like something else	* is going on.	*

RUGRAT	* You don’t look at his eyes.	*

DONNIE	* Say “thank you for being here”.	*

ROBBIE	* You don’t turn your back on him.	* It’s a sign of disrespect.	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	35.


DONNIE	* If you want a cracker or something	* - I’m gonna have some treats in my	* pocket. I want to be in a strip	* club with you guys. Literally pull	* out a brief case and have a little	* fuckin' guy pop out of there. You	* know how much fuckin' pussy you	* get?	*

JORDAN	* The point is get it out.	*

DONNIE	* Get the jokes out now. Get the	* fuckin’ jokes out now.	*

JORDAN	* You’re gonna fuck it up. Purge all	* this shit right now.	*

DONNIE	* That’s what I’m saying -	*

JORDAN	* When he comes in the room, I want	* him to feel like a human being -	*

DONNIE	* Business. Business. It’s fuckin’	* business, bro.	*

JORDAN	* I want him to feel just like a	* normal human being. Cause you know	* - like one of us. One of us.	*

DONNIE	* Like he’s an actual human being.	* One of us.	*

JORDAN	* Gobble, gobble we accept you, one	* of us! One of us!	*

ALL	* One of us.	*

Janet pokes her head in.	*

JANET
Your dad’s coming. With the American Express bill.

JORDAN Can you stop him?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	36.


JANET Fuck you, you stop him.

The guys straighten up and head to desk, settle in. Max	* blows in past her, waving a 3-inch-thick bill:

MAX
$430,000 dollars in one month!! Four-hundred-and-thirty-thousand dollars in one month!!

JORDAN
Hello, Father.	* (Max’s expression
doesn’t budge)
They’re business expenses. Just	* relax.	*

The guys titter at “business expenses.”

MAX
If you bastards don't wipe those smug fucking looks off your faces, I swear to God I'm gonna wipe ‘em off for you!
(back to Jordan) Are you insane?

ROBBIE	* Actually, Max, my portion of the
bill is hardly anything, so I’m on the same page as you --

MAX
Shut the fuck up, Feinberg, you only have a portion because of my son, you worthless twerp!

DONNIE (chuckles)
Twerp.

MAX
You zip it, too, Azoff, those boiling teeth of yours are hurting my fucking eyes!
(turning to Jordan)
My own son! From my very loins!
What do you think this is?	*

JORDAN Will you calm down --

MAX
You don't think there's any end in sight, do you? It's all one giant party to you schmendricks!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	37.

MAX (CONT'D) (holds up AMEX bill)
$26,000 for one dinner!!

JORDAN Donnie ordered sides.

DONNIE Yeah, that was... Sorry.

MAX (glowering)
What is EJ Entertainment? What is EJ Entertainment?!

JORDAN (restraining a grin)
You tell me, Dad.

MAX
It’s a goddamn prostitution ring is what it is!!

Jordan feigns shock, turns to Donnie: did you know it was a prostitution ring?!

DONNIE
Doesn’t the IRS allow for T&A?

MAX
It’s T&E and stop fucking with me! What kind of hookers take credit cards, anyway?!

Jordan takes the bill, starts flipping through it.

JORDAN (V.O.)
In Stratton parlance, there were three kinds of hookers. There were blue chips, the top of the line. Model material. They were priced between $300 and $500 and made you wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip, which I always did.


77A	A “BLUE CHIP” HOOKER FLOATS THROUGH, SURROUNDED BY	*77A STRATTON BROKERS.	*

JORDAN (V.O.) Then came NASDAQs, who were pretty, but not great, usually in the two to three hundred dollar range.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	38.


77B	A “NASDAQ” HOOKER DANCES THROUGH BULLPEN. STRATTON	*77B BROKERS WATCH.	*

JORDAN (V.O.) Finally there were pink sheets, skanks, the bottom of the barrel.


77C	A “PINK SHEET” HOOKER, COVERED IN TATTOOS, IS ON ALL	*77C FOURS AS SEA OTTER RIDES HER LIKE A PONY.	*

JORDAN (V.O.) They usually cost a hundred or less, and if you didn't wear a condom, you'd get a penicillin shot the next day and pray your dick didn't fall off.


77D	THE ABOVE-MENTIONED “PINK SHEET” HOOKER SITS ON A STOOL,	*77D AS SEA OTTER FUCKS HER.	*

JORDAN (V.O.)
Not that we didn’t fuck them, too. Believe me, we did.

Behind him, the other guys wait their turns.	*

77E	BACK TO SCENE	77E

Max continues to steam so Jordan ushers Robbie, Rugrat and Donnie out the door.

JORDAN
Give us a minute, will you, guys?

He closes the door, then stretches a bit, exaggeratedly, letting out a little moan.

MAX What’s the matter?

JORDAN
Nothing, just... My back’s been killing me. Pain shooting down my leg. Not to worry, it’ll pass.

MAX
What do the doctors say?

JORDAN
Doctors, what do they know? I’m on like twenty different medications.
(re: the Amex bill)
Look, I know it's hard for you to make sense of these expenses, but
there's a method here, okay?	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	39.


Max waits to hear it; Jordan gestures to the bullpen	*

MAX
And you have to lead by example, is that it?
(Jordan nods)
I’m tellin’ ya, kid, one of these days... one of these days the
chickens are gonna come home to	* roost.

JORDAN	* In order to keep these guys	* working, I gotta keep ‘em	* spending. I need to keep them	* chasing the dream. You flash some	* cash, they do the same. It keeps	* them motivated.	*

MAX	* Pissing away money? That’s what	* motivates you kids?	*

JORDAN	* I could afford to pay them more,	* but then they wouldn't need me as	* much. And as long as they need me	* they'll always fear me. I know it	* sounds crazy.	*

MAX	* Crazy? This... is obscene.	*

He turns and exits. Jordan watches him go, thinking.

JORDAN (V.O.)
It was obscene -- in the normal world. But who wanted to live there?


78	EXT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - DAY (JUN ‘92)	78

Massive, with an Olympic-size pool overlooking the beach. Dozens of luxury cars parked outside. On a balcony, Jordan is mid-speech, in a bathing suit, addressing the Strattonites below, Teresa at his side.

JORDAN (O.C.)
-- so enjoy yourselves, you all deserve a celebration. ‘Cept for
Kimmie, she’s lazy and she steals.	* (off laughter, Kimmie	*
flips him the bird; he blows her a kiss)
But, everybody, keep this in mind.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	40.

JORDAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) As my friend Donnie Azoff says,
“If you wanna party with the boys, you gotta wake up with the men.” Monday morning I want you all looking razor-sharp. Cuz Stratton’s got a few things on the horizon, things that’re gonna take it right up into the fucking stratosphere!

The Crowd goes nuts. One Broker lets loose a wolf-howl, and the crowd toasts Jordan, chanting his name.

CROWD
Jor-dan! Jor-dan! Jor-dan!

As Jordan looks down smiling like a benevolent dictator --

JORDAN (PRE-LAP) Fuck Merrill Lynch, this way we become the underwriters.

ROBBIE (PRE-LAP)	* Like an investment bank.


79	INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - (LATER THAT) DAY	79

GORGEOUS PEOPLE dance/drink/snort coke. Upstairs, Jordan plays pool with Sea Otter, Donnie, Robbie, Toby and Rugrat, assigning ludes with every pocketed ball.

JORDAN
Exactly. We do our own IPO’s and we will print money.

SEA OTTER
Eat like a bird, shit like an elephant, baby!

JORDAN
They can take their Harvard asses under our desks and suck our cocks.
(to Rugrat)
How soon can you get the paperwork filed?

RUGRAT (super-stoned)
Can’t we talk about this Monday?

JORDAN
It’s a simple fucking question.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	41.


RUGRAT
Except I’m looking at three of you right now.

ROBBIE	* We’ve got Arncliffe National,
they’re looking to go public, we’ve got --

DONNIE (very luded)
Oh, oh, Steve... Steve...

JORDAN What?

DONNIE ...Steve... M-m-madden...

Donnie gesticulates wildly. The guys crack up. WE PUSH IN ON Donnie, practically drooling, as Jordan gives us a quick tutorial on ludes...

79A	QUAALUDE TUTORIAL	*79A

CUT TO: Extreme close up of guys doing drugs.	*

JORDAN (V.O.)
The quaalude was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor --that’s dot Indian, not feathers --as a sedative, and was prescribed to stressed housewives with sleep disorders. Pretty soon someone figured out that if you resisted the urge to sleep for fifteen minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass high from it. Didn’t take long for people to start abusing ludes, ‘course, and in 1982 the U.S. Government Schedule One’d them, along with the rest of the world. Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left. No shit, you can’t even find ‘em anymore today. You people’re all shit outta luck.



79B	BACK TO SCENE	*79B

JORDAN (to Donnie)
What’re you saying, buddy? (to the others)
Shhhh... listen to him...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	42.


DONNIE Ssshhhhoes... shhhoooess...

Jordan suspects Donnie may actually be onto something. But just then...

SEA OTTER Holy fuck.

Jordan peers over the balcony where Sea Otter’s looking.

NAOMI LAPAGLIA. 22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered the party with her date BLAIR. She smiles, full lips parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts.

RUGRAT
My nutsack’s about to explode.

ROBBIE	* Someone’s gotta take that down.

There’s no debate who that someone should be. Eyes locked on Naomi, Jordan makes his way downstairs.

WITH NAOMI taking in the party, her eyes flitting to things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.

NAOMI (V.O.)
A lotta people would look at me and think: “golddigger, she’s out to land the richest husband she can.” But you see, I came from nothing. Like, below the poverty line. And when you come from nothing, being rich means never having to go back to that.

Jordan approaches CRISTY, 20s, one of his guests.

CRISTY Jordan, hey.
(he smiles; Cristy picks up his intent)
Have you met my friend Naomi?

Jordan takes Naomi’s hand, doesn’t let go.

JORDAN Naomi.

NAOMI
You have an awesome house. I don’t think I’ve ever been in a house like this.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	43.


JORDAN
You like it? I just got it. I guess it’s okay. Six bedrooms, two hot-tubs, one off the master suite overlooking the water. You like to jet-ski?

Naomi’s date Blair offers his hand to break them apart. Toby Welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye.

BLAIR
Hi. Blair Hollingsworth.

Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi.

Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa. Her eyes stray to Jordan chatting up Naomi. Teresa’s eyes follow hers and sees them. Ouch. Hildy goes.

JORDAN
You’re telling me you’ve never jet-ski’ed in your life?!

NAOMI Never.

BLAIR
Y’know, we really should hit it, there’s two other parties we’re s’posed to get to --

JORDAN
What? You just got here. Stay.

Naomi looks like she’d like to. Hildy approaches, introduces herself, then:

HILDY
Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

JORDAN With what?

HILDY
I dunno, you’ll have to ask your wife what she wants.

Jordan sees: Teresa is watching from afar.

DONNIE(O.S.) Oh sweet Jesus!

Jordan turns to see a drunk Donnie, cock in hand, jerking off to Naomi. Hildy comes running over.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	44.



Donnie! doing?!
HILDY
What the fuck are you

During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party --

JORDAN (V.O.)
The day I met Naomi was the day I truly became the Wolf. Every guy wanted her -- so I had to have her.

-- Jordan watches her go. Naomi shoots a glance back to him and, like that, he’s hooked.


80	SCENES 80 - 81 OMITTED	80


82	INT. SIGN OF THE DOVE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT (JUN ‘92)	82

Romantic; elegant. Over a bottle of ‘53 Lafite, Jordan sits in mid conversation with Naomi, who is stunning in a low-cut black cocktail dress.


Bay Ridge. Island?
JORDAN
That’s near Staten

NAOMI
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge. Guinea gulch. Ever been?

JORDAN You’re Italian?

NAOMI
My dad’s side. Also Dutch, German, English -- I’m a mutt. Actually I have family over there, in London. My Aunt Emma.

JORDAN That explains it then.

NAOMI What?

JORDAN (smiles)
You’re a Duchess. The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

Naomi smiles, flags a passing WAITER.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	45.


NAOMI
Could I have a straw please?

The Waiter nods, heads off. A few beats, then:

NAOMI (CONT’D) So I was a little surprised you asked Cristy for my number.

JORDAN How come?

NAOMI Aren’t you married?

JORDAN
Married people can’t have friends?

Naomi smiles. The Waiter brings the straw. She opens it, slips it in her red wine glass. Off Jordan’s look:

NAOMI
So I don’t stain my teeth.

And as she sips the wine seductively through the straw...


83	EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT	83

Jordan’s Ferrari makes its way over the bridge, heading back toward Brooklyn.

NAOMI (O.S.)
--then at night I do my designs.


84	INT. JORDAN’S FERRARI - CONTINUOUS	84

Jordan drives, Naomi next to him.

NAOMI
An entire line of lingerie --camisoles, bustiers, panties.

Jordan glances over -- her dress is riding up her thigh.

JORDAN (V.O.) She designs panties?! Jesus fucking Christ!

Naomi smiles.

JORDAN
Sounds like something I might invest in. Venture capital.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	46.


NAOMI
Well we should definitely keep in touch, then.

JORDAN Absolutely.

He pulls over outside her brownstone.

NAOMI That’s me.

JORDAN (V.O.) Think, Jordan, think! How can you get up to her apartment?!

They look at each other. We can almost hear Jordan’s heart pounding.

NAOMI
You wanna come up for some tea?


85	INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT	85

A small, cozy apartment. Naomi enters, Jordan close behind. She picks up Rocky, her yapping Maltese.

NAOMI Say hi, Rocky.

Naomi waves Rocky’s paw. Jordan smiles.

NAOMI (CONT’D)
Why don’t you light a fire? I’ll be right out.

Jordan nods, takes in her scent as she walks away.

JORDAN (V.O.) God, please help me. How can I fuck this girl?

As he crouches by the fireplace, his skypager vibrates. He checks the readout: “Teresa”. His face falls as he hits the “silent” button, mind racing with guilt.

JORDAN (V.O.) That’s it, you’re leaving. You’re going home to your wife.

Jordan stands, turns around -- NAOMI is in the doorway, naked except for high heels.

JORDAN (V.O.) As you can probably guess, I fucked her goddamn brains out.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	47.


86	INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT	86

Rocky yaps incessantly as Jordan pounds away atop Naomi.

JORDAN (V.O.) For eleven seconds.

Jordan cums loudly, convulsively.

JORDAN I’m sorry, I--

NAOMI Did you cum?

JORDAN (nods; gasping)
Yeah, but I’m still hard.

Jordan looks down at her.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) Being inside her... was like your cock went to heaven and God
himself was cupping your balls.

And as they start fucking again...


87	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	87 (JUN ‘92)

Jordan sits at his desk, telephone to his ear.

JORDAN (V.O.) I couldn’t get enough.


88	INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - DAY (JUN ‘92)	88

CLOSE ON Naomi, who talks on the phone, smiling. We PULL BACK to see the apartment is packed with flowers.

JORDAN (V.O.) Every chance we got, we’d sneak off together...


89	INT. LIMOSINE - NIGHT (AUG ‘92)	89

Giggling like a child, Jordan pours coke from a vial, creating a little mound atop one of Naomi’s breasts.

JORDAN Hold still, don’t move.
(to the Driver) Watch the potholes!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	48.


More giggling, then he snorts the coke off her breast, burying his face in it as he climbs on top of her. Naomi laughs uncontrollably as the limo glides to a stop. The door opens from outside -- the Doorman?

TERESA (O.S.) Get out of the fucking car.

Jordan looks up, locks eyes with Teresa. He jumps off Naomi, stumbles out, closing the door behind himself.


90	EXT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS	90

JORDAN
What are you doing home?
TERESA
That whore from the party? How could you do this to me?!

The limo takes off. Teresa starts crying...

JORDAN
I thought you were at the beach house, I--

TERESA
I married you when you had nothing--

JORDAN Teresa... I don’t know what to say.

TERESA
You’re like a totally different person.

JORDAN
I’m not. I’m sorry. I made a mistake, okay?

TERESA
Tell me you don’t love her.

JORDAN I...

TERESA (off his silence)
Jordan?

Jordan says nothing. Finally, Teresa starts sobbing.

JORDAN (V.O.) I felt horrible.

Jordan holds her, letting her cry.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	49.


JORDAN (V.O.) Three days later I filed for divorce and moved Naomi into the apartment.


91	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - DUSK	91 (SEP ‘92)

Completely remodelled, all new furniture. Jordan and Naomi sit at the table, set for a candle-light dinner.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style. She brought in a decorator, feng shui’d the place--she even hired a gay butler.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER, 40s, enters with hot towels on a silver tray.

JORDAN Thank you, Nicholas.

Jordan takes a towel, wipes his face. Naomi smiles.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) He was smart, sophisticated,
really great. Except for that one time...


92	SCENES 92 - 94 OMITTED	*92


95	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT	*95

A GAY ORGY is in progress, a dozen naked MEN, including Nicholas, in various sexual positions about the room.

NAOMI Omigod!


96	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT	96

Jordan sits across from a very shaken Naomi.

NAOMI
He must have thought I was at my mother’s.

JORDAN
Where were they? In the bedroom?

NAOMI They were right here!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	50.


A beat, then Jordan realizes. He jumps off the couch like it’s on fire.

NAOMI (CONT’D) It gets worse. After I chased
them out, I checked the apartment.

JORDAN (V.O.)
The motherfucker stole fifty grand in cash and jewelry.


97	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIBRARY - DAY	97 (OCT ‘92)

With Nicholas seated in a chair, Jordan sits across from him. Pacing behind him is Donnie, coked-up, face contorted, frothing with rage. Nearby, giant Chester Ming sits quietly, saying nothing.

JORDAN
I just want my stuff back, okay?

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER I didn’t take anything.

DONNIE (in his face)
I should kill you, cocksucker! You do not fuck with this man!

Jordan holds Donnie off. Turns back to Nicholas.

JORDAN
You were high, things got out of control, I get it. Believe me I do, I have a Phd in debauchery.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER I didn’t do it.

DONNIE
I’ll knock your fuckin’ teeth out, motherfucker!

JORDAN
Just give me the money, give me the jewelry, and we’ll forget the whole thing.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER It’s because I’m gay, isn’t it?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	51.


JORDAN
Nicholas. You could fuck a baby sheep as far as I care, on my brand new fucking sofa. What I won’t stand for is being robbed.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER I’m telling you the truth.

JORDAN
I’ll ask you one last time.

DONNIE
You’re dead, you piece of shit!

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER Jordan, please.

JORDAN Fine.

Jordan nods to Chester. Without a word, he crosses to Nicholas and BAMMM!! Nicholas’s nose splits open like a ripe plum, blood spurting everywhere. Tough-guy Donnie takes one look, then SPEWS vomit into a garbage pail. And as Chester pummels Nicholas’s face into chopped meat...

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) It’s amazing the kind of loyalty money will buy. I mean Chester almost killed this prick.

Chester starts to hang Nicholas over the balcony by his legs. Jordan stops him.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I finally called the cops, mainly to save Nicholas’s life.


98	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY	98

With the bloodied Nicholas in the background, Jordan talks to two NYPD COPS, handing them each a wad of cash.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I gave them each a thousand bucks and told them what Nicholas had done. Then they kicked his ass.

As the Cops swat Nicholas with their nightsticks:


COP #1 Fuckin’ thief, huh?
COP #2 Piece of shit.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	52.


And as they hustle Nicholas out...

JORDAN (V.O.) Loyalty, like I said. Which was the key component to my incredible fucking success.


98A	EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY (OCT ‘92)	98A

As Jordan golfs with Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Toby and	* some hookers, Brad pulls up in a golf cart with a cash-	* filled gym bag.

JORDAN (V.O.) Besides Brad, I had eight other ‘ratholes’, close friends who’d own stock on paper, but kick the profits back to me after I drove the price through the roof.

They hug, then Jordan adds the gym bag to several others on the back of his golf cart. Donnie tries to befriend Brad; Brad isn’t interested.

JORDAN (V.O.)
The SEC knew I was doing something shady, but they couldn’t figure out what the fuck it was.


99	SCENES 99 - 100 OMITTED	99


101	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - (ANOTHER) DAY	101

Jordan, Max and securities lawyer MANNY RISKIN exit the kitchen with coffees.

MANNY RISKIN I’m telling you -- piss on the
SEC’s leg, you’ll end up with your tits in a ringer.

FREEZE FRAME - Manny stuffs a cruller into his mouth.

JORDAN (V.O.) My securities attorney, Manny
Riskin. Seven hundred an hour to	* be the voice of doom.

BACK TO SCENE

JORDAN
It’s under control. Will you relax already?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	53.


Just then, Max spots a BROKER break-dancing as three other Brokers look on...

MAX
What the fuck is this imbecile doing?!

Max crosses off, starts screaming at the break-dancing Broker. Jordan keeps walking with Manny.

JORDAN (V.O.)
The SEC sent two lawyers down to review our files, so I set them up in our conference room.

Jordan passes the conference room, looks in the window--two SEC ATTORNEYS wear coats as they review documents.

JORDAN (V.O.) Then I had it bugged and the air conditioning locked till it felt like Antarctica in there.

One of the SEC Attorneys blows into his hands for warmth. Manny follows Jordan toward the bullpen, his frenzied Brokers working the phones.

JORDAN (V.O.)
So here they were, looking for a smoking gun while I was firing a bazooka right under their noses. It was our first IPO, and we were driving the stock price to the fucking moon.

BROKER #1 Arncliffe National, it’s on fire!

BROKER #2 (voice lowered)
Believe me, your grandkids will thank you.

BROKER #3 (to Sales Assistant)
Arncliffe National, ten thousand shares!

Jordan speaks directly to camera as he continues walking through the bullpen.

JORDAN
See an IPO is an initial public offering, the first time a stock is offered for sale to the general population.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	54.

JORDAN (CONT'D) As the firm taking the company public, we set the initial price,
then sold those shares back to --	* (stops; then)
You know what, you’re probably not	* following what I’m saying. The	* question is, “was it legal?”	* Absolutely not. But we were making	* more money that we knew what to do	* with.	*

103	INT. BANK - SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT - DAY (OCT ‘92)	103

Alone in a private room, Jordan unloads a small suitcase filled with stacks and stacks of hundred dollar bills.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But I figured it out.	*

CLOSE ON - a huge diamond engagement ring.

NAOMI (O.C.) Omigod!!


104	INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - NIGHT (OCT ‘92)	104

Jordan is down on one knee, proposing; Naomi hyperventilates as he puts the ring on her finger -- a seven carat, yellow canary diamond in a platinum setting.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I held my bachelor party at the
Tangiers in Las Vegas -- one last	* blowout for the Gods before I
settled down for good.


105	SCENE 105 OMITTED	105


106	INT. TRANS CAPITAL AIRLINES - JUMBO JET - NIGHT	*106

Inside a jumbo jet, a wild, mid-air party is in progress.

JORDAN (V.O.)
A hundred Strattonites flew in with fifty hookers and enough drugs to open a pharmacy.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	55.


Various images -- Stratton Brokers drink, do coke, a half-dozen in mid-orgy with Hookers, naked in the aisle as others pour champagne on them.

JORDAN (V.O.) All told, the weekend cost me almost two million dollars--


107	PERIOD VEGAS ADS	*107


108	INT. TANGIERS - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY	*108

The Tangiers Presidential Suite is a shambles on the	* level of Hiroshima. A giant crystal chandelier lays shattered on the floor; Jordan asleep in the massive bed,
a Blue Chip Hooker on either side of him; other passed-out BODIES lay amid debris and broken, toppled furniture.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But the wedding was like something out of a fairy tale--


109	EXT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - SUNSET (DEC ‘92)	109

Gorgeous; tropical. Hundreds of FAMILY and FRIENDS (Janet, Toby Welch, Peter DeBlasio and Kimmie Belzer) look on as Jordan and Naomi walk up the aisle.

JORDAN (V.O.)
--with Naomi my Duchess, me her handsome Duke and The Bahamas Ocean Club our castle.


110	INT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - BALLROOM - NIGHT	110

Jordan and Naomi waltz, their Guests joining in.

JORDAN (V.O.) Of course after that bachelor party, the Duke needed a few penicillin shots so he could
safely consummate the marriage.


111	INT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - BALLROOM - LATER	111

As Jordan and Naomi mingle with a few Strattonites, videographer BARRY KLEINMAN, 40s, approaches Rugrat and his DATE, ABBY with a video camera:
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	56.


BARRY KLEINMAN I’m Barry Kleinman, filming the wedding -- would you like to say something to Jordan and Naomi?

RUGRAT / ABBY Good luck! We love you!

Across the way, Naomi spots someone through the crowd--

NAOMI Omigod! Aunt Emma!

Naomi rushes over, hugs her AUNT EMMA, 50s, demure, British. Naomi turns, calls out to Jordan, who is now in a huddle with the guys, his back to her.

NAOMI (CONT’D) Jordan! Look!

Jordan turns, then crosses to them, smiling.

AUNT EMMA Jordan dear, how lovely.

JORDAN
It’s so nice to see you again.

As he leans in to hug her, Aunt Emma spots some white powder on the edge of Jordan’s nostril. Deftly, she wipes it off, smiling.

AUNT EMMA Into the donuts, I see.

JORDAN Oh, I’m--- uh...

Aunt Emma leans in to his ear.

AUNT EMMA
I lived through the 60s, my dear. Enjoy the day.

And with that, she turns back to Naomi.


112	EXT. BAHAMAS - MARINA - DAY (DEC ‘92)	112

With Naomi wearing a blindfold, Jordan leads her to the end of a long dock, expensive yachts moored everywhere.

JORDAN Careful now. You ready?

Jordan removes her blindfold -- there, towering above the others, is a stunning, 120 foot yacht.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	57.


NAOMI What is this?

JORDAN
Your wedding present. Check out the name.

She does; it’s called “Naomi”. As she squeals, hugs him-

JORDAN (V.O.) For three weeks we sailed the Naomi through the Caribbean--


113	INT. YACHT NAOMI - DAY (DEC ‘92)	113

The camera PUSHES IN past a white-jacketed STEWARD,
who opens the door to the yacht’s main salon; next we see the living room, with its full bar and leather couches; then the bedroom, with a king bed and monogrammed sheets.

JORDAN (V.O.)
--eventually taking her home to Long Island, where we’d bought a house.


114	EXT. CARIBBEAN - OPEN OCEAN - DAY (DEC ‘92 - JAN ‘93)	114

The Naomi sails the calm waters, Jordan and Naomi popping ludes, sunbathing blissfully on the deck.

JORDAN (V.O.) Seven acres on the Gold Coast of Long Island--


115-115K EXT./INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - DAY (APR ‘93)	115-115K

Various shots -- the massive house; the glistening pool; waterfall; fountains; tennis court; driving range; gazebo; gym; sauna; library; media room.

JORDAN (V.O.)
--the most expensive real estate in the world, with maids, cooks, landscapers, you name it.

115L	WE SEE the household STAFF lined up outside the house.	115L

JORDAN (V.O.)
We even had two guards who worked in shifts, both named Rocco.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	58.


116	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	116

Amid billowing piles of white Chinese silk, Jordan sleeps on his back, snoring blissfully.

JORDAN (V.O.) It was heaven on earth.

On screen WE SEE:

18 MONTHS LATER

Splash! A glass of water hits him in the face.

NAOMI
Wake up, you bag of shit!

Soaking wet, Jordan sits upright to see Naomi standing over him in a tiny pink chemise, holding an empty glass.

JORDAN The fuck are you doing?!

NAOMI Who’s Venice?

JORDAN What?!

NAOMI
Who is she?! Some little hooker you fucked last night?

JORDAN What? No! Naomi!

And as Naomi storms off for a re-fill...


117	INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE (FEB ‘95)	117

Jordan lies on the ground, hands tied with a lit candle	* up his ass.	*

JORDAN	* Venice, where are you?	*

VENICE, A Blue Chip Hooker, enters, pulls out a candle	* and straddles him. She drips wax on his back and pulls	* his hair.	*


118	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	118

Back to scene. Naomi holds another full glass, rocking back and forth on the balls of her feet like a fighter.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	59.


NAOMI
You were calling her name in your sleep!

JORDAN
I can explain everything.

NAOMI
Go ahead. More lies from the man who lies for a living!

JORDAN
No, really. Donnie and me, we’re investing in a condo development in Venice.

NAOMI Italy?!

JORDAN California, baby.

NAOMI Yeah, right.

JORDAN Duchess, come on.

NAOMI
Don’t ‘Duchess’ me, you scumbag. You think I don’t know what you’re up to? You’re a father now and you act like an infant!

Splash! She nails him again, crosses for more water.

JORDAN
Fuck. Naomi! Why are you so mad?

NAOMI
Where do you want me to start? How about you flying in here on your stupid helicopter at three in the morning waking up Skylar?!


119	EXT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - YARD - NIGHT (FEB ‘95)	119

Jordan crash-lands the helicopter on the driving range.	* He exits, gives Captain Dave a salute, fights his way	* through the bushes, then stumbles toward the house and	* falls into the pool, stoned out of his skull. Security	* floodlights come on and the alarm sounds.	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	60.


NAOMI (O.S.)
Does it even matter to you that I just had that driving range sodded with Bermuda grass?


120	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	120

Back to scene. Naomi holds another glass of water.

NAOMI
But why should you give a shit? You're not the one who researched the fucking thing and dealt with the fucking golf course people!

JORDAN
You’re an aspiring landscape architect?! But what happened to wine connoisseur? Oh wait, that was last month!

NAOMI Fuck you!

Naomi winds up with the water glass. Jordan stands tall, puffs himself up, arms flexed at his sides.

NAOMI (CONT’D) Stop flexing your arms, you look like a fucking imbecile.
(re: his crotch)
And don’t think that impresses me much.

Jordan looks down: he has a morning erection.

JORDAN
I wasn't flexing my arms. You're just lucky to have a husband who's in such great shape. Now get over here and kiss me!

NAOMI Kiss you?!

Splash! She nails him one last time, then storms out. He stands there dripping wet. To his erection:

JORDAN
Where the fuck were you last night?

JORDAN (V.O.)
My morning ritual. First I’d get up and fight with Naomi about whatever I did the night before.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	61.


120A	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - STEAM SHOWER - DAY	120A

Jordan stands in the steaming shower.

JORDAN (V.O.) Next it was a steam so I could sweat out whatever drugs were still in my system.


120B	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS	120B

Jordan looks at himself in the mirror. His eyes are bloodshot - he looks like shit.

JORDAN (V.O.) After that I’d assess the damage.

Jordan looks at a Visine bottle - “Recommended Dosage -Two Drops”. He squirts six drops in each eye.

JORDAN (V.O.) What kind of maniac abuses eye drops?


121	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	121

Fully dressed and standing amid hundreds of suits, Jordan pops two white pills, swigs some juice.

JORDAN (V.O.) Then I’d get dressed, take my “back pills” to get me started,
then attempt to make up with her.


122	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - SKYLAR’S ROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	122

Jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland. On the fluffy pink carpet is Naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her hips, Manolo Blahniks showing polished red toes. Between her legs sits SKYLAR, their 5-month-old daughter.

JORDAN Hey, Skylar.

NAOMI (little girl voice)
Good morning Daddy. Where’s my kiss?

Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	62.


JORDAN (playing along)
Does Daddy get to kiss both his girls?

NAOMI
Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy for a very, very long time.

Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she’s wearing no panties. The wind goes out of Jordan.

JORDAN
C’mon, Nay, please. You know how sorry I am. I swear I--

NAOMI (cutting him off)
Daddy shouldn’t waste his time. And from now on it's going to be nothing but short, short skirts around the house! And Mommy’s so sick and tired of wearing panties, uhhh. In fact she’s decided to throw them all away.
(parting her thighs)
So take a good look. You’ll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house, but no touching.

She licks her lips seductively. Jordan sets Skylar aside, starts grovelling.

NAOMI (CONT’D) What’s wrong, Daddy?

Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking it. Jordan can barely speak.

JORDAN
C’mon, why are you doing this? I said I’m sorry.

NAOMI (pouting)
Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to say how wrong he is when he’s ready to come in his own pants. Isn’t that right Dada? Mommy loves Daddy so, so much and there’s nothing she wants to do more right now than to make love to Daddy all day long. Well, I guess it’s time for Daddy to be taught his first lesson.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	63.


Naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her inner thigh, then up toward her vagina. Jordan watches transfixed, then a change comes over him...

JORDAN
I wouldn’t do that if I were you Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a story before she decides to please herself like that.
Can Daddy tell Mommy a story? (off her nod)
And does mommy promise to keep her legs spread wide, wide open the whole time?
(she nods dreamily)
Good. Once upon a time there was a great big mansion in Long Island and the people who lived there had lots and lots of money. But of all the possessions they had, there was one thing that was much more valuable than all the rest combined, and that was their little baby daughter.

Naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Now because he was very security-conscious, the Daddy hired two full-time guards, big hairy men both named Rocco, and they installed security cameras all around the house. And one of those cameras is right over Daddy's shoulder.

Naomi’s eyes widen -- she look toward a Teddy Bear on a shelf. WE SEE that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera.

JORDAN (CONT’D)
So smile, Mommy! You're on Candid Camera!


123	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - GUARD HOUSE - DAY (FEB ‘95)	123

Mesmerized, ROCCO DAY watches a video screen, on which we see a grainy image of Naomi, hand between her legs.


124	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - SKYLAR’S BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	124

Naomi jumps up as if she’s been electrocuted.

NAOMI You asshole!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	64.


As she bolts from the room, Jordan plays with Skylar...

JORDAN (V.O.)
The good thing about living with a world-class ballbreaker is they make all the other ballbreakers in your life a little easier to take.


125	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - OUTSIDE JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	125 (FEB ‘95)

Donnie stands talking with Jordan’s assistant, Janet. Jordan approaches under a head of steam.

DONNIE There he is.

JORDAN
(a quick hug; then) Steve here yet?

DONNIE
On his way. Very excited.

JORDAN
Good. Cuz we have a problem.

He indicates out to the Bullpen. Donnie and Janet look.

JANET (incredulous)
Is he wearing a bow tie?

In the Bullpen WE SEE a young Stratton Broker in a bowtie cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk.

JORDAN
He’s got nothing better to do on the day of the biggest IPO in this firm’s history?!

Jordan watches as Donnie marches toward the Broker in a bowtie...


126	INT. BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS	126

DONNIE The fuck you doing?

BROKER IN A BOWTIE (bewildered)
Cleaning my fishbowl.

DONNIE Oh.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	65.


Donnie nods, turns to go, but suddenly he turns back and thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming goldfish. The Broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified.

DONNIE(CONT’D) On new issue day?! On cocksucking, motherfucking new issue day?!

Dozen of Brokers and Sales Assistants look over as Donnie snatches up the fish. Holding it by its tail, he jumps	* up on the desk of the Broker in a bowtie. Now the entire Bullpen looks over.

DONNIE(CONT’D)
This is what happens when you fuck with your pets on new issue day!

With the flair of a showman, Donnie pops the fish in his mouth, swallowing it whole. The Brokers cheer wildly. Donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the Broker in a bowtie:

DONNIE(CONT’D) Now take your bowtie, get your shit and get the fuck out!

Bowtie is stunned. And as Donnie storms off, we PUSH IN on Jordan, watching from across the room.


127	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	127 (FEB ‘95)

Jordan finishes a phone call as Donnie enters with STEVE MADDEN, 30s, dressed in wrinkled navy blazer, cargo pants and T-shirt, a baseball cap over his scraggly, thinning hair. Jordan smiles, crosses to greet him.


The Cobbler.


Hey buddy.
JORDAN
Ready to get rich?

STEVE MADDEN

And as they ad lib greetings, settle in at the couch:

JORDAN (V.O.) Steve Madden, the shoe designer, was a childhood friend of Donnie’s, but I didn’t hold that against him. Remember those ads, those giant-headed girls with bug eyes wearing those big clunky shoes?

127A	INSERT - a quick series of Steve Madden ads.	127A
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	66.


JORDAN (V.O.)
He came to me a few years earlier when he was just starting out, so I became a silent partner in his company, buying an 85% stake for only a million bucks.


128	INT. STEVE MADDEN SHOES - DAY	128

WE SEE various stores, all packed with teenage GIRLS buying shoes and boots.

JORDAN (V.O.) The company blew up and we were
now taking it public. It was the biggest deal we’d ever done and the hottest IPO on Wall Street.


129	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	129 (FEB ‘95)

Jordan and Donnie sit with Steve Madden in mid-conversation.

DONNIE
--which is why they need to meet you.

JORDAN
You gotta get ‘em fired up so they’ll push the shit out of this stock.

DONNIE
Let them feel your passion.


130	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (FEB ‘95)	130

Bustling with activity. With Jordan and Donnie looking on from nearby, Steve Madden approaches a microphone on the raised platform, in his hands several shoe boxes.

STEVE MADDEN (into mic)
Uhhh... excuse me...

The place slowly comes to order.

STEVE MADDEN (CONT’D) For those of you who don't know
me, my name is Steve Madden. I'm --

ONE BROKER We know who you are!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	67.


Steve clears his throat, looks over at Jordan -- he’s terrified. Jordan motions for him to calm down.

STEVE MADDEN
I uh, I'd like to start by telling you about my background in the shoe industry.

ANOTHER BROKER Nice fucking hat!

STEVE MADDEN
I uh... first started working in the shoe industry, in a shoe store. When I was sixteen, my friends were out chasing girls, but I was learning about women's shoes.

KALIL Move the mike closer.
PETER DEBLASIO
We can’t fucking hear you!	*

He moves the mic; feedback SCREECHES through the bullpen.

STEVE MADDEN (CONT’D) Sorry... Anyway, my first job
was at a shoe store like I said where I worked in the stockroom. You know, I can honestly say I’ve been a lover of women's shoes since I was twelve--

BROKER #4 Freak!

STEVE MADDEN No. Heh-heh. Not like that.
I mean somehow I became fascinated with the endless design possibilities for women's shoes--


BROKER #5 Queer!
BROKER #6 Get a fucking life!

Boos, hisses. Steve looks at Jordan, who motions for him to speed up. He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes.

STEVE MADDEN (CONT’D) This shoe -- the Mary Lou -- is
the one that really put me on the map. It’s a black patent leather variation of the Mary Jane, but--

SPLAT! A half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steve’s feet. In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic--
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	68.


JORDAN
All right, let's hear it for Steve Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!

Huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Okay, now that you got that out of your system, I want you to know why Steve is so completely off the fucking wall... It’s because this man is a creative genius. Steve's power, his gift -- is that he creates trends. Artists like Steve come along once a century! Elvis! Andy Warhol! Giorgio Armani! Who knows how high this stock could go? The 20s? The 50s? The 80s?

Applause; war whoops. Jordan motions for quiet.

JORDAN (CONT’D) I want everybody to look down.
See that little black box in front of you? It's called a telephone. Now I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about this telephone -- it won't dial itself! That’s right -- until you take some action, it's nothing more than a worthless hunk of plastic, like a loaded M16 without a trained Marine to pull the trigger. And in the case of the telephone, it's the action of you, a highly trained Strattonite, a killer who will not take no for an answer! A person who will not hang up the phone until his client either buys or fucking dies!

The Brokers go crazy. Jordan looks around.

JORDAN (CONT’D)
I don't care if you graduated from Harvard or Bumfuck University or never got past fourth fucking grade! That phone is the great equalizer!
(pause; looks around) There is no nobility in poverty.
I've been rich, and I've been poor and I choose rich every time.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	69.

JORDAN (CONT’D) At least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show
up in the back of a limo wearing a $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch!

Jordan takes off his GOLD WATCH, flings it to the Crowd. Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball.

JORDAN (CONT’D) And if anyone here thinks I'm crazy, get the fuck out and get a job at McDonald’s, because that's where you fucking belong! But before you depart this room full of winners, I want you to take a good look at the person next to
you, because one day in the not-so-distant future, you'll be sitting at a red light in your beat-up old Pinto, and that person’s gonna pull up in a brand new Porsche, with their gorgeous young wife at their side. And who will you be next to? Some ugly beast with three days of razor-stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in next to you with a carload of groceries from the fucking Price Club!

He scans the Brokers; they’re on the edge of their seats.

JORDAN (CONT’D) So you listen to me and listen
carefully. Are you behind on your credit card bills? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Is your landlord threatening to evict you? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking loser? Pick up the phone and start fucking dialing! I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich! I want you to go out and spend money! Leverage yourself, back yourself into a corner, let the consequences of failure become so fucking unthinkable that you'll have no choice but to do whatever it takes to win!

The Brokers go absolutely APESHIT.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	70.


JORDAN (CONT’D) You have an obligation here,
people! To your clients! To this firm! An obligation to yourself, godammit! You ram Steve Madden stock down your clients’ throats and make them choke on it till they buy 20,000 shares! Be aggressive! Be ferocious! Be telephone fucking terrorists!!

Before Jordan is even finished, the Brokers GO BERSERK, some already dialing their phones.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) At 1 p.m. we opened the stock for sale at $4.50 a share. By 1:03
it was over eighteen dollars.


130A	INT. FBI OFFICES - MANHATTAN - DAY	130A

Agent Denham exits the elevator, arriving for work. He strides between cubicles, briefcase in hand. He enters --


130B	INT. AGENT DENHAM’S OFFICE - DAY	130B

-- where pinned up on one wall is a massive chart on Stratton’s operations: pictures of Jordan, Donnie and others, a hierarchy, a history, an investigation...


131	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - LATER (FEB ‘95)	131

Total sales frenzy. The CAMERA PANS the 300 Brokers, who work the phones like mad.

SEA OTTER
--the hottest new issue on Wall Street!
YOUNG BROKER
--up two dollars while I’m talking to you!

And as we continue PANNING the room...

JORDAN (V.O.) Of course I couldn’t have done
this without help. I’d leaked the word on Wall Street that Stratton was a buyer up until twenty. So not only were we pushing Madden, all the big firms were too.

We continue PANNING the frenzied Brokers...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	71.


JORDAN (V.O.)
As long as they knew I’d buy the shares back at the top of the market, they’d drive the price up as high as I fucking wanted.


132	SCENES 132 - 133 OMITTED	132


134	INT. JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY (FEB ‘95)	134

Donnie pours champagne nearby, oblivious to Jordan, who sits at his desk, speaking directly to camera:

JORDAN
Of the two million shares being offered for sale, a million belonged to me, held in phony accounts by my ratholes. Once the price hit the high teens, I--

Jordan abruptly stops. A beat, then:

JORDAN (CONT’D) Like I said before, who gives a shit? As always, the point is this--

BACK TO SCENE -- Donnie hands Jordan a glass of Dom.

DONNIE
22 million in three fucking hours!

They toast, then each pop ludes, which they wash down with champagne. A quick knock; Janet pops her head in.

JORDAN Janet, baby. Drink.


Call for you. Future Video?


Who?
JANET
Barry Kleinman from


JORDAN

JANET
He filmed your wedding. He says it’s urgent.

Curious, Jordan leans over, hits the speaker phone:

JORDAN Barry?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	72.


135	INT. FUTURE VIDEO - DAY (FEB ‘95)	135

Barry Kleinman sits at his desk, talking on the phone.

BARRY KLEINMAN Jordan, hey. Listen, I got a subpoena. The FBI wants a copy of your wedding video.

On Jordan. Uh-oh.

JORDAN (V.O.) The F-B-fucking-I?


135A	INT. FIRING RANGE - DAY	135A

Wearing goggles and protective headphones, square-jawed FBI Agent Patrick Denham takes target practice.

BO DIETL (V.O.) Name’s Denham, he’s an agent in the New York office.

JORDAN (V.O.) What’s his problem?

BO DIETL (V.O.) He’s a boy scout, thinks you’re Gordon Gekko.


135B	EXT. RAO’S - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING (MAR ‘95)	1*35B


136	INT. RAO’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT (MAR ‘95)	136

The East Harlem institution. Jordan sits across a table over pasta with private investigator BO DIETL, 40s.

JORDAN
But my goddamn wedding video?

BO DIETL
Got your whole inner circle in one place, faces and names. He’s hoping it rattles you, or maybe your wife, so that she starts nagging you to turn witness.

JORDAN (that’s laughable)
What? He wants me to rat on myself?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	73.


BO DIETL (shrugs)
Good news is I made some calls, DEA, Justice? No one but him even knows who you are.

JORDAN
Can you bug him or something, tap his phone?

BO DIETL Jordan, relax. First off, you
don’t fuck with these guys, not that way. Secondly, I got a P.I. license, you know?

JORDAN
Maybe I should call him, see what he wants.

BO DIETL
No! Anybody does that should be your lawyer. What you do is eat your dinner, drink your drink, and forget about it. Cuz as far as I hear he doesn’t have shit.

Jordan nods, wheels turning, pretending to do as told.

136A	SCENE 136A OMITTED	1*36A


137	EXT. BATTERY PARK MARINA - DAY (LATE SPRING ‘95)	137

As Agent Denham steps into frame, another FED, AGENT	* HUGHES, beside him, both G-man stoic in impenetrably dark * glasses --

JORDAN (O.S.) Patrick? Hey! C’mon aboard!

They look up. On the yacht Naomi, Jordan stands waving, drinking wine with two Blue Chip HOOKERS in bikinis.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Plank’s right down there.

Denham shares a look with his cohort: it’s almost a joke, this display of wealth before a federal agent. Moments later, they step aboard.

AGENT DENHAM Mr. Belfort, I’m Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	74.


JORDAN Heya! This is Nicole and,
um...Heidi. Girls, Patrick and...?

AGENT DENHAM Agents Denham and Hughes. Your message said you wanted to speak privately.

JORDAN It did. I do.
(off Denham’s stare) Oh, they’re just friends.
(to the girls) Give us a minute, okay?

The Hookers head below deck. Jordan shoots Denham a wink--check out that ass!

JORDAN (CONT’D) Can I get a glass? Got wine open or any kinda booze. Shrimp and lobster’re over there if you’re hungry.

AGENT DENHAM
Bureau forbids us from drinking at sea.

Jordan surprised: the guy has a sense of humor.

JORDAN
I have something for you, I just gotta find it. Have a seat, will ya? Ever been on one of these before?

As Jordan rifles through some papers, Denham’s eyes scan the deck, casually cataloguing everything.

AGENT DENHAM
A boat? Learned to sail when I was six.

JORDAN
I mean, one like this. Just had her extended to put a chopper on the back.

Jordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter.

AGENT DENHAM
Never been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of it.

Jordan finds the file he’s been looking for, offers it.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	75.


AGENT DENHAM (CONT’D) (before he’ll accept)
What is this?

JORDAN
Names and addresses of every guest at my wedding. Friends, clients. I even threw in the seating chart. Heard that’s why you wanted the video, figured this’d expedite whatever it is you’re doing.
(Denham looks: it’s indeed a guest list from the wedding)
I wanted to show you I’ve got nothing to hide. I know you’re investigating Stratton but for the life of me I can’t figure out why. Sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn’t? Maybe we’re a little louder than most but we don’t do anything illegal. Talk to the SEC, they’ll tell you, they checked us out up and down.

AGENT DENHAM The SEC’s actually a civil regulatory agency. We pursue criminal activity.

JORDAN
That’s what I’m saying. You guys take on real crime. Which is why I’m so curious: what do you think we did?

The reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes.

AGENT DENHAM I can’t discuss ongoing investigations.

JORDAN I understand.

AGENT DENHAM Though, to be frank, this case kinda got dumped on my desk. Some higher-up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press, fell on me to do the looking.

JORDAN
You know who you should be looking at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	76.

JORDAN (CONT'D) What those guys’re up to with collateralized debt obligations? This internet stock bullshit? C’mon. If you want, I’ll walk you through exactly --

AGENT DENHAM
-- that’d be great. And if there’s anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk--

JORDAN
-- sure, get you back to the real criminals --

AGENT DENHAM
-- then we could both profit from this little sit-down.

Jordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by “profit”?

JORDAN
You sure you don’t want anything to drink? Water for your pal?
(Denham demurs)
Rumor is your started out in finance. Even got your broker’s license before you joined the bureau.

AGENT DENHAM Who told you that?

JORDAN (searches his memory)
Jeez, who was it...? (comes up short)
Ever regret it? Giving up the money-crazed, pin-striped life? Ever think where you’d be if you’d stuck with it?

AGENT DENHAM
When I’m riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit I’ve worn three days, sure.

JORDAN
Whattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don’t mind me asking. 50-60K a year?

AGENT DENHAM
Just about. We get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn’t suck.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	77.


JORDAN
S’crazy, the world we live in, the jobs with real value, the ones we should appreciate -- firefighters, teachers, FBI agents -- those are the ones we pay the least.

AGENT DENHAM Way of the world.

JORDAN
That’s one thing I like about what I do, the opportunity to make that right. Take this kid we had interning last year. Didn’t want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third-rate care. Some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and --boom -- overnight everything changes, she’s seeing the best doctors in the country. Sadly, didn’t work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while.
(as Denham considers that)
See, it’s all about proper guidance, Pat. Knowing someone with the right relationships, who’s discreet. I can change a life almost every day.

They measure each other.

AGENT DENHAM
How much that intern make off your deal?

JORDAN North of half a million.

Denham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan:

AGENT DENHAM
Can you say that again, what you told me?
(Jordan declines with a smile; to Agent Hughes)
I believe Mr. Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	78.


JORDAN
What? I was making conversation.

AGENT DENHAM Sounds like that to me, Jordan.

JORDAN ...no, no, no...

AGENT DENHAM ...sounded like that...

JORDAN
...no, to constitute a bribe, don’t I have to make an explicit offer of money for services? With an exact dollar figure attached? All I said was “north” of half a million. According to the U.S. Criminal Code, that dog won’t hunt, Pat.
(then)
Heard you were a straight arrow. That you wouldn’t bend the rules other agents might. He was right.

AGENT DENHAM
You did a background check on me?

JORDAN
Figured you were looking into me, was only fair. Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part.

AGENT DENHAM
This is why you invited me down to your yacht? With a couple hookers on it --

JORDAN
-- those are friends --

AGENT DENHAM
-- to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you?

Jordan puts his hands up: “you got me.”

JORDAN
Thanks for coming down. Now get off my boat.

AGENT DENHAM
You know, most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust, they were born to the life.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	79.

AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D) Their father was a douchebag
before them, and his father before that. But you, you got this way all on your own. Good for you, Jordan.
(as he starts to go) Thank you for having us. I’m
absolutely certain we’ll see each other again.
(before he does)
You know, this is about the nicest boat I’ve ever been on. Just think what a hero I’ll be in the office when the bureau seizes it.

Jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can’t let Denham get the final word. He calls after them:

JORDAN
Hey, Denham! I’m gonna eat a claw of lobster now as I get my cock sucked by Heidi down below. You have a super ride home on the
subway thinking about that!	*

As he watches them pull away, seething --

JORDAN (V.O.)
He was a numbers guy, a follow-the-fucking-money’er. He wasn’t gonna come at me through my guys, looking for a weak link and a quick kill. He was gonna come at me like an accountant would, the way Ness got Capone, through my books. Which meant? It was ass-covering time.

As Naomi looks on, 5 months pregnant, Jordan packs a suitcase.


Switzerland? Switzerland?
NAOMI

JORDAN
Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you fucking think?


139	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY	*139 (SUMMER ‘95)

Jordan sits talking with Rugrat and Donnie.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	80.


JORDAN (V.O.) Rugrat set up a meeting with a Swiss Banker he knew from law school who could launder our money, but it wasn’t till noon the next day.

Jordan glances at his watch, washes down a few ludes.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I knew if I timed my lude intake right, I’d sleep through the entire overnight flight.


140	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	140

Jordan stands before the Bullpen talking to his Brokers.

JORDAN (V.O.)
At four p.m. I popped a few ludes, which started kicking in by the time I finished our sales meeting. This was the tingle phase.


141	INT. CANASTEL’S - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘95)	141

Over dinner, a visibly high Jordan ravenously digs into his food as Donnie and four Blue Chip Hookers look on.

JORDAN (V.O.) By dinner I popped a few more on top of some cocktails and an valium or two. The slur phase.


142	INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘95)	142

On the crowded dance floor, Jordan gets knocked around like a marionette, saliva strung from his mouth.

JORDAN (V.O.) By eight thirty I’d done a few
more and pretty much lost my motor skills. This was the drool phase.


143	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘95)	143

Jordan is barely conscious as a Hooker rides him.

JORDAN (V.O.) And by ten I didn’t know who or what I was doing -- the amnesia

144	INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘95)	*144

Jordan boards, slurring, drooling, completely wasted.

JORDAN (to a Stewardess)
Sweetheart! Look at you!

And as he hugs her, then stumbles toward his seat...


145	INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	*145

Quiet; morning sunlight bleeds through the window. Jordan’s eyes flicker open. He yawns, looks around, tries to get up; he can’t move. He looks down, sees six seat belts restraining his arms and legs. Jordan looks over at Donnie, mouth agape, asleep next to him.


Donnie.


Nuuhh?
JORDAN Donnie, wake up.

DONNIE

JORDAN
Untie me, shitbag. You think this is funny?

DONNIE
I didn’t tie you, the captain did. He almost tasered you.

JORDAN Why?


146	FLASHBACK --	146

As PASSENGERS scream, Jordan wildly humps a STEWARDESS, the CAPTAIN struggling to restrain him.

JORDAN (V.O.) This was fucking great. I hadn’t laundered a dime yet and already I was under arrest.


147	INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	*147

A pensive Jordan sits, mind racing.

JORDAN (V.O.) Worse yet was the plastic baggie of ludes that Donnie’d stuffed up his ass.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	82.


Jordan trades looks with Donnie, who shifts uncomfortably.

JORDAN (V.O.) But before he could even get a hemorrhoid--

Jordan sits with two CUSTOMS OFFICERS.	*

JORDAN (V.O.)	* --the whole thing was quashed by	* our friend the Swiss banker. Which	* was lucky for me, since so far I’d	* been able to keep Agent Fuckface	* unaware of the trip.	*

Another CUSTOMS OFFICER enters, whispers something to the * others. They shake Jordan’s hand and he leaves.	*


148	EXT. GENEVA - SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	148

149	INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - LOBBY - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	149

JEAN-JACQUES SAUREL greets them. 30s, suave. The lobby is ultra-modernist.

SAUREL Jordan Belfort! At last!
Nicholas has told me so much.

RUGRAT Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel.

JORDAN
Nice to make your acquaintance. This is some lobby you got.

SAUREL
Ah, yes. We gave our designer an unlimited budget and he exceeded it. Come! You must tell me all about your adventure with the stewardess over coffee!

They disappear upstairs.

151	INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAUREL’S OFFICE - DAY	151

Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and
one other SWISS BANKER. It’s an impressive office, with	* an enormous fish tank.

DONNIE
We have a joke in America. “Heaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss.” I never got it ‘til now -- look at those fucking fish! Come here, little guy...

SAUREL
Yes, we have the same joke here. Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French. The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that.

Polite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish, cuts straight to the point:


JORDAN
I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws.

SAUREL
Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit-chat before business can be discussed.
(a smile)
Of course, let’s get “down to it.” What would you like to know?

JORDAN
Under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an FBI or U.S. Justice Department investigation?


Ca depend.


Ca depend?
SAUREL


JORDAN
Ca depend on what?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	84.


SAUREL
Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months.

RUGRAT
Want me to see if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix?

More chuckles. Through Jordan’s forced smile:

JORDAN (V.O.) What I’m asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over.

SAUREL (V.O.) I understand perfectly, you American shitheel.

Saurel smiles.

SAUREL
The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland. But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your “rumored” improprieties. Which is why Mr. Azoff’s joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you. If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette. We would wipe our ass with it.

Everyone’s impressed. Except Jordan.

JORDAN
Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland. Then you’d have to cooperate.

SAUREL
(now he’s impressed) Yes, we would. Assuming the account is under your name.
However, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours...

They take each other in.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	85.


JORDAN (V.O.)
Was that yodeling I just heard or did you just say what I thought you said?

SAUREL (V.O.) Yes! Yes!

As the meeting wraps up with handshakes, Jordan’s V.O. overwhelms Saurel’s V.O..

JORDAN (V.O.) He was telling me to use a
rathole. Problem was: sneaking a U.S. rathole into Switzerland was a chance I couldn’t take. What I needed was somebody with a European passport.

Naomi’s Aunt Emma answers the door.

AUNT EMMA Jordan?

155	EXT. HYDE PARK - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	155

Amid towering trees and horse trails, a noticeably twitchy Jordan walks arm-in-arm with Aunt Emma.

AUNT EMMA
So tell me about this plan of yours.

JORDAN
I’d like us to go to Switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account. I’ll fund it, and I’ll pay you really well for your trouble.

AUNT EMMA Oh my.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	86.


JORDAN
Next month maybe you can fly to New York and we can start moving the cash.

AUNT EMMA Moving the cash.
(smiles)
I feel like a character in an
Ian Fleming novel. It’s all quite racy, isn’t it?

JORDAN
It is, and it’s illegal too. Of course if you ever got in trouble, I’d come forward in two seconds, say I duped you, but even still.

AUNT EMMA
Risk is what keeps us young, isn’t it darling?

JORDAN
I like that attitude. Promise me	* you’ll spend at least ten thousand
pounds per month out of the account, okay?

AUNT EMMA (chuckles)
I wouldn't even know how. I really do have everything I need.

JORDAN But I bet you don't have
everything you want. How about a bigger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over?

Aunt Emma notices that Jordan is sweating, fidgety. He’s jonesing.

AUNT EMMA Shall we sit?

JORDAN Sure, that’d be great.

They sit on a nearby bench. After a while:

AUNT EMMA Sometimes I wonder if you let money get the best of you, dear.
(beat)
Among other substances.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	87.


JORDAN It’s that obvious, huh?

AUNT EMMA
It’s the height of summer and	* you’ve got the chills.	*

JORDAN
I’m a drug addict, Emma. Coke,	* pills, you name it, whatever you	* got. Sex addict too.	*

AUNT EMMA (laughs)
Well there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.

JORDAN (chuckles; then)
Why did I just tell you that?	*

AUNT EMMA (playful)
Because I’m very easy to talk to.

Jordan looks at her. A few beats, then:

JORDAN
As a matter of fact you are. My	* job, you know, it’s tough. I mean	* I’m not complaining, it’s just the
stress. All these people depending	* on me. Millions of dollars at	* stake every day. I sometimes feel	* I’ve bitten off more than I can	* chew.	*

AUNT EMMA
You’re a man with large appetites.

Jordan looks at her and smiles:

JORDAN (V.O.) Is she fucking hitting on me?

JORDAN
I agree. I put it on myself. It’s	* hard to control the anxiety, you	* know? It’s hard to learn to relax.	*

AUNT EMMA To release the tension.

JORDAN (V.O.)
She is hitting on me! Holy shit!

Jordan leans in closer, casually slips an arm around her.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	88.


JORDAN
Exactly, to release the tension.	* Sometimes you gotta learn to do	* what comes natural in life, huh?	*

Aunt Emma pulls back slightly.

AUNT EMMA (V.O.) Is he fucking hitting on me?

He leans in even closer, kisses her, then:	*

AUNT EMMA Stability, dear. Family.

AUNT EMMA (CONT’D)	* You take care of my niece, my

155A	INT. BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - SOUTH HAMPTON - DAY	155A (SUMMER ‘95)

Jordan fucks Naomi. There’s a curious thunk-thunk-thunk.

JORDAN (V.O.)
When I got home, I realized there was no way Aunt Emma could smuggle that much cash by herself. I racked my brain for another person with a foreign passport.

The bed’s covered with bundles of cash. Every thrust of Jordan’s, another bundle plummets to the floor -- thunk.

With $20 mil in CASH on the bed, Jordan and a stoned Donnie watch as Brad tapes stacks of cash to his wife CHANTALLE, a bombshell in panties, bra and sneakers.

CHANTALLE
Bra-had, theese tape eez focking steeky!

As Brad keeps taping her up:
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	89.


JORDAN (V.O.)
As a successful drug dealer, Brad spent his winters in the South of France, which is where he met his wife Chantalle, a stripper of Slovenian origin but born in, of all places, Switzerland.

CHANTALLE
Take eet off, Bra-had! Eet erts!

BRAD Shut up, bitch.

CHANTALLE
You beetch, you focking douche-a-bag-a!

Donnie can’t help but start laughing at this.

DONNIE
Take eet off! Take eet off!

Brad seethes at this but keeps taping...


159	INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - BEDROOM - LATER	159 (SUMMER ‘95)

Chantalle is completely taped up, a cash-covered mummy. Jordan looks on with Brad, Donnie and now Naomi. 90% of the cash is still on the bed.

JORDAN Well, this is fucked.

NAOMI
It’s gonna take her like fifty trips.

BRAD
We’ll get her parents to tape up too. They got Swiss passports. Plus her brother and his wife. Five people, six-seven trips?

JORDAN
How much’ll they want for it?

BRAD
I dunno, not much. Fuck, they’d probably do it just for the miles.

DONNIE What about my money?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	90.


BRAD What?

DONNIE
My money. I got a few mil of my own I wanna move. I’ll call you, you can come pick it up.

BRAD (takes offense to
Donnie’s presumption)
You’ll “call” me.

DONNIE (what part don’t you
understand?)
And you can come “pick it up.”

Brad asks Jordan if they can speak in private.

MOMENTS LATER, IN PRIVATE: Jordan joins Brad.

JORDAN What’s wrong?

BRAD
Don’t make me deal with this fucknut, okay?

JORDAN
Donnie? He’s just high is all.

BRAD
I dunno if he’s stupid or a junkie but he’s a loose fuckin’ cannon. I don’t trust him and I don’t want him around me.

JORDAN
Jesus. I thought he was your best customer.

BRAD
I only sell to him cuz he’s your friend.

JORDAN
Can you just do one trip for him?

Brad stews. It’s asking a lot.

BRAD
I’ll meet him but I won’t pick up. I have a limit of how much of that douchebag I can take.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	91.


DONNIE

Donnie emerges from where he’s been eavesdropping.

DONNIE (CONT’D) I’m a douchebag?!! Well, whose fucking idea was it made us all this money?!! Who fucking knew Steve Madden?!! This douchebag!! So go fuck yourself a little!

Brad slaps Donnie so hard across the face he goes down.

Brad waits by his Range Rover as Donnie’s Rolls careens into the lot. He emerges, briefcase in hand.

DONNIE Fu Manchu! Kung fu!

Donnie starts doing spastic karate moves. Is he high? Sure looks like it. Brad looks pissed, and Donnie starts laughing. Actually he’s dead sober.

DONNIE (CONT’D) I’m just fucking with you, man. Jesus, the look on your face.
(Brad isn’t laughing)
Hey, sorry if I got outta line the other day, I was just, that was the drugs talking...

BRAD
S’cool, just... gimme the case.

DONNIE (he doesn’t)
You know, I always kinda regretted you didn’t come to work with us at Stratton. It’d be so cool having you around, man.

BRAD (growing impatient)
Yeah, well...

DONNIE
You’d be one of us, we’d go out-partying together, you wouldn’t have to dress like a mall rat guinea prison bitch all the time.

Donnie grins, obviously still smarting from Brad’s slap. Brad just wants to take the money and be done.

BRAD Give me the money.

A DISTANCE AWAY, a COP in a patrol car notices Brad gesturing to Donnie for his briefcase. He nudges his partner: check this out.

DONNIE
Can I come over and help tape this to your wife? “Eez so focking steeky! Take eet off, Bra-hod!”

Brad composes himself, lest he kill the guy.

BRAD
Yes. Just gimme the money.

DONNIE
You’re gonna give me a pass? Okay...

Why don’t you stick your pass up your Slavic cunt’s pussy.

That does it. Brad attacks. Donnie throws the case at him, which opens on impact, money spilling out. Brad instinctively tries to contain it... and that’s when the POLICE SIRENS start. Here comes the patrol car.

BRAD Shit!

Donnie bolts. With no time to get to his car, Brad takes off on foot, bleeding briefcase in hand, toward a video store where he stashes his .38 in the return box.

POLICE Freeze! Don’t move!

Brad drops to his knees, briefcase at his feet. From a distance, Donnie peers around a corner to watch him get arrested, knowing he fucked this up.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) The Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail
of Quaaludes, outlawed since the ‘80s and three times as powerful as anything available today. For a Quaalude addict, it was like finding a 1952 Chateau Margaux.

Jordan can’t respond. Phone still to his ear, his eyelids droop. Drool spills from his slackened jaw.

JORDAN (V.O.) After fifteen years in storage, the Lemmons had developed a delayed fuse.

JORDAN’S POV -- is hazy as he stares at his own reflection in the pay phone.

Jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach for it; he can’t. He lays there for a while, then:

Ignition on, Jordan sits hunched over, chin resting on the steering wheel. Just then, the car phone RINGS. With great effort, he pushes the speaker phone button:

JORDAN ...ello?

NAOMI (O.S.) Omigod! Jordan, where are you?!

JORDAN Whazz a marra?

NAOMI (O.S.)
It’s Donnie, he’s totally out of control! He’s on the other line with some Swiss guy!

Jordan’s face reads horror.

JORDAN Whaa?!! No!!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	100.


NAOMI (O.S.)
I can’t understand you! Just get home, hurry!

Naomi clicks off. And as Jordan puts the car in gear...

JORDAN (V.O.) They say God protects drunks and babies. I was praying the same held true for drug addicts.


191	EXT. HEGEMAN’S ROAD - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER ‘95)	191

Peering over the wheel like an old lady, Jordan slowly maneuvers the Lamborghini down the dark road.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I was less than a mile from home and drove slower than shit.


192	EXT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER 95)	192

Jordan pulls up in the Lamborghini, shuts the ignition.

JORDAN (V.O.) Somehow I made it alive, not a scratch on me or the car.


193	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER ‘95) 193

CLOSE ON the TV, where a POPEYE cartoon is playing. PULL BACK to reveal Skylar watching. As Jordan staggers in, Naomi approaches...

JORDAN Where Zonnie?!

NAOMI In the kitchen.

Phone to his ear and at least as stoned as Jordan, Donnie stands at the counter.	*

Having been just woken up, Jean-Jacques Saurel sits up in bed, phone to his ear, a perplexed look on his face.

SAUREL
What language are you speaking, Mr. Azoff?


196	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS	196 (LATE SUMMER ‘95)

With Naomi looking on, Jordan staggers toward Donnie like a drunk Frankenstein.

JORDAN
Ge ozza zone! Ge ozza iz!!

DONNIE
Waz? Iz zoggin oo anzali!

JORDAN GE OZZA ZONE!!

With all the strength he can muster, Jordan RIPS the phone from the wall, throwing it skittering across the floor with a CLANG.

NAOMI
What the fuck are you doing?!

DONNIE
Wazza fuh is wrong wizzz oooo?!! I wuzz awwing to!!
(Jordan grabs him)
Wazza mazzer?! Wazza yoo razy?!!

Skylar looks on from the next room, crying as Jordan
tries to shake some sense into Donnie. Naomi crosses to	* Skylar and rushes her out of the room.	*

JORDAN
Zee vone!! He nah zuppose zoo dalk on zee vone!!

DONNIE Wuzz?!!

JORDAN

DONNIE WUZZ?!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	102.


JORDAN WUZZ ZOD IN ZAW?!

DONNIE WUZZ?!

Fuck it. Jordan releases Donnie. Donnie crawls into the	* dining room and starts shoving ham into his mouth in an	* effort to sober up. Just then, we HEAR a horrible	* GAGGING sound. Donnie holds his throat as he falls	* backward choking, taking out the entire glass kitchen
table with a tremendous CRASH! Naomi rushes back in.	*

NAOMI
Omigod, he’s choking! Jordan, do something!!

Just then, WE HEAR the triumphant Popeye FANFARE --Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of spinach down his gullet. Instantly, his chest and arm muscles swell to five times their size.

Jordan goes to get his coke. He snarfs up two fat spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue...

Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue.

NAOMI (CONT’D) He’s not breathing!

Jordan places his fingers over Donnie’s artery. Nothing.

NAOMI (CONT’D) Save him!

Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnie’s chest, breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts.

JORDAN (V.O.) This stupid sonovabitch! All
Donnie ever did was fuck me up and now I had to save his life ‘cause I took a CPR class when the baby was learning to swim. Just for the record, I want it noted: not for a second did I even think about letting him choke to death, even though it would’ve saved me an awful lot of headaches.

Donnie still isn’t breathing. Jordan flips him over, tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks Donnie’s ribs. He flips him back over, but he’s almost completely blue.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	103.


JORDAN He won’t come back!

NAOMI
Don’t let him die! He has children!

One last try. Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as hard as he can into Donnie’s lungs. Donnie’s stomach distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham projects from his mouth and into Jordan’s face. Donnie coughs, vomiting. And as he starts breathing again,
Jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch.	*

FADE TO BLACK.

BROOKVILLE POLICE #1 (V.O.) Jordan Belfort?


196A	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - FAMILY ROOM - DAY	196A (LATE SUMMER ‘95)

Jordan opens his eyes. Through his HAZY POV, we see Violet, the maid standing over him with two OLD BROOKVILLE POLICE OFFICERS as Naomi attends to Donnie in the background.

JORDAN Yes?

BROOKVILLE POLICE #1 Sir, we need to ask you some questions.

Jordan exits the house with the Police Officers. The Lamborghini is TOTALLED, an absolute wreck.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Wow. Maybe I hadn’t made it home okay.


201	EXT. HEGEMAN’S ROAD - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER ‘95)	201

FLASHBACK. Nodding out, Jordan drives the Lamborghini like a maniac, careening off parked cars and trees.

JORDAN (V.O.) It was an absolute miracle I
wasn’t killed, and an even bigger miracle I hadn’t killed anyone.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	104.


201A	INT. POLICE STATION - DAY (LATE SUMMER ‘95)	2*01A

A MAN steps up to get his mug shot taken, but it’s Brad, not Jordan. FLASH. Turn to the side. FLASH.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But they couldn’t arrest me, the cops had no proof I’d been behind
the wheel. Meanwhile, Brad did a	* few months in jail for contempt	* because he wouldn’t rat Donnie
out. They never found his gun, though, so they finally had to let him go.

202B	EXT. HORSE FARM - LONG ISLAND - DAY (OCT ‘95)	202B

Jordan watches an INSTRUCTOR lead Skylar on a pony. Nearby Naomi holds newborn PARKER. Manny Riskin and Max stand beside Jordan.

MANNY RISKIN You’re a lucky guy, Jordan. Legally I’ve never seen anyone slip a noose the way you do. Christ, you’re lucky to be alive much less not in jail.

JORDAN
I don’t believe in luck.

MANNY RISKIN That’s what all lucky people say. It’s time, Jordan. Let me make a deal with SEC. Before your luck runs out.

Skylar waves from the pony and Jordan waves back.

JORDAN What kind of terms?

MANNY RISKIN
You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations -- stock manipulation, high pressure sales tactics, ticky-tack shit like that. You pay a few million dollars in fines and in exchange the SEC fucks off for all time.

JORDAN
And Stratton? What happens there?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	105.


MANNY RISKIN You’d have to walk away. Let Donnie take over.
(that one hurts)
Now the FBI’s a different animal. They can still pursue you for criminal wrongdoing. But with you on the sidelines, my guess is your best friend Agent Denham’ll be left standing around with his dick in his hand.

Jordan digests that.

MAX
You beat them, Jordan. You won. Sail into the sunset with your wife and kids while you can.

MANNY RISKIN God knows you’ll never have to work again.

As Jordan looks at his picture-perfect family, WE HEAR THE ROAR OF A CROWD...

202C	SCENES 202C - 202D OMITTED	202C


202E	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY	202E (SPRING ‘96)

The troops ROAR as Jordan takes center stage.

JORDAN
I’m sure many of you have been hearing rumors lately, about me, about the future of this firm, and that’s what I’d like to talk to you about today.
(a few beats, then) Five years ago when I started
Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day would eventually come when I’d be moving on. It’s truly with a heavy heart that I tell you that day is here.

The place erupts in a chorus of “No!”, “Don’t go!”, etc. Jordan raises his hand for quiet.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Thank you for that and for your years of incredible loyalty and admiration.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	106.

JORDAN (CONT’D) The point is though, that under Donnie’s leadership, along with Robbie Feinberg and Nicky Koskoff moving into key management positions, this place is gonna be better than ever!

A smattering of applause. Jordan notices a few Brokers gravely shaking their heads.

JORDAN (CONT’D) And the fact that I'm gone won’t
stop me from giving Donnie advice, not that he needs any--

DONNIE (jumping in)
Why would anyone in their right mind not follow JB's advice?

Donnie looks petrified; he’s used to being an offensive tackle, not the quarterback.

JORDAN
Before I go, there’s something I want to remind you all, and that’s this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger than any one person, even me. Especially me. You guys are Stratton, each and every one of you, and that is why it’s sure to remain the best brokerage firm in the fucking world!

Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all 300 Brokers on their feet. WE PUSH IN on Jordan.

JORDAN (CONT’D) See, the very idea of Stratton is that when you come here and step into this bullpen for the first time, you start your life anew. You have a place here and no one can take that away from you! Stratton Oakmont is America! Give me your tired and poor! The very moment you walk through that door and pledge your loyalty to this firm, you become part of a family, you become a Strattonite! It doesn’t matter who you are, it doesn’t matter where you’re from! Whether your family came over on the Mayflower or on a fucking inner tube from Haiti!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	107.


More applause. Jordan scans the young faces -- they worship him. In the crowd he finds KIMMIE BELZER, 30s.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Everybody here knows Kimmie Belzer, right?

Hoots and hollers... He raises his hand for quiet.

JORDAN (CONT’D) In case any of you weren't aware of it, Kimmie was one of Stratton's first brokers, one of the original twenty. Now when most of you met Kimmie, you met her the way she is today -- a
beautiful woman who drives a brand new Mercedes, a woman who lives in the finest condo complex on Long Island. A woman who wears $3000 Armani suits, who spends her winters in the Bahamas and her summers in the Hamptons!

Wild applause.

JORDAN (CONT’D) But that’s not the Kimmie I met. The Kimmie I met was broke, a single mom on the balls of her ass. Three months behind on her rent with an eight year old son! She came to me for a job and when I hired her she asked for a $5000 dollar advance so she could pay his tuition. And what did I do, Kimmie?

KIMMIE
You wrote me a check for $25,000!

JORDAN
Because I believed in you, like I believe in each and every one of you!

KIMMIE I love you, Jordan!

As the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the adoration. He looks at Donnie, turns back to the Crowd, looks out at the faces. A change has come over him.
He stands there, thinking. An eternity, then:
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	108.


JORDAN
You know for years I’ve been telling you guys not to take no for an answer, to keep pushing, to not hang up the phone till you get what you want. This deal I’m about to sign, barring me from the securities industry, barring me from Stratton, my home... What the fuck is that? I’ll tell you what it is, it’s me being a hypocrite. It’s me taking no for an answer, it’s them selling me, not the other way around! Fuck it, I’m not leaving!

Jordan smiles, thrusts his hands in the air --

JORDAN (CONT’D) THE SHOW GOES ON!!

The place goes absolutely INSANE. And as Donnie and Max trade looks, TECHNO MUSIC BLASTS taking us to...

JORDAN (V.O.)

ON ANOTHER BAG, this one brimming with bottles of pills, bags of pot, vials of coke. Jordan and Donnie cut up lines as a HOSTESS serves Bloody Marys.

HOSTESS
Can I get you anything else, gentlemen?

JORDAN
I have a rare condition that requires me to drink one of these every fifteen minutes. If you could set your egg timer, I’d appreciate it.

She goes. The blow is ready for inhaling. Jordan and Donnie are doing a “you first, no, you first” routine with a rolled up $100 when a CELL rings. Donnie grabs it.

I need some time to think.	*

Jordan thinks, snorts a line to think better.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Even though I owned 85% of Steve-Cocksucker-Madden-fucking-Shoes, the shares were in his fucking name. Motherfucker knew I was in trouble with the Feds and was trying to take advantage.

He gets back on the phone with Rugrat.

The sight of Naomi and Hildy returning from their trip ashore stops him. Because Naomi’s weeping, Hildy consoling her.

JORDAN (CONT’D) What the fuck?! What happened?

Off Jordan’s reaction as Naomi weeps and laments the dearly departed: “she was so young, so healthy” etc. --

Thanks but where does this leave us in regard to her account? It goes into probate or what?

SAUREL
Not to worry, Jordan. Your aunt, before she died, signed a document naming you as her successor.

JORDAN She did?!

SAUREL (a sly grin)
Well. Not as of yet.

And as they continue talking, Jordan pulls out a nautical map of the Italian coastline:

JORDAN (V.O.) I gotta say, these Swiss were sneaky motherfuckers. Within
minutes he made arrangements to set me up with a forger, the best document specialist in Geneva.

Off to the side, Jordan watches as Naomi, their Friends, and the yacht’s Crew Members dance to blaring techno music. A small group of Italian SAILORS cheer them on.

JORDAN (V.O.) The nice thing about getting rescued by Italians is that the first thing they do is feed you and make you drink red wine. Then they make you dance.

Jordan watches as the dancing continues, then casually glances out a porthole, where WE SEE the distant lights of a PLANE making its way across the night sky. After a few beats, the plane EXPLODES, a tiny flash of light.

JORDAN (V.O.) Did you see that? That was the
plane I sent for to come get us. I shit you not, it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine, three people killed. You want a sign from God, well after all this I finally got the message. I had to make some fucking changes.

WE START WITH FLASHES OF THE SEMINAR: Jordan in front of a dry erase board, lecturing a small audience.

JORDAN
At the essence of every personal interaction, of every business transaction, of every effective human communication is PERSUASION... once you learn to control the linguistic encounter, you will be SHOCKED at what will happen... you are a person worth listening to, and taking it one step higher than that, you are someone who can help them achieve their goals...

Do you dream of being financially independent but struggle every month just to pay your bills?
Would you like to own a home like	* this one someday but can barely
afford to pay your rent? (ZOOM IN ON HIM)
My name is Jordan Belfort and there’s no secret to wealth creation. No matter who you are,
where you came from, you too can	* become financially independent in

(NEW ANGLE; he enters from same side as previous shot)
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	119.

JORDAN (CONT’D) The first action you have to take is to DECIDE to be wealthy. When I was 24 years old, I made a DECISION not to just survive but
to THRIVE. I started my own stock
brokerage firm, developing a	* SYSTEM OF SELLING that within a
year made me a multi-millionaire.

There’s nobody stopping you from                  * making millions.

218	INT. CENTRAL BOOKING - QUEENS - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	218

CLOSE ON JORDAN’S HANDS, at last in cuffs. PAN UP TO HIM, looking none-too-pleased.

JORDAN (V.O.) This one takes the cake. It was Rugrat, he’d been busted down in Miami, and guess who the fuck with?


219	EXT. MIAMI RESTAURANT - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	219

Jean-Jacques Saurel is handcuffed by Feds as Rugrat looks on crying, handcuffed nearby.

JORDAN (V.O.)
What were the odds? There had to be ten thousand Swiss bankers in Geneva and I choose the one dumb enough to get himself arrested on U.S. soil.


220	INT. MIAMI FBI OFFICE - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	220

CLICK! Saurel gets his mug shot taken.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	121.


JORDAN (V.O.) Even more ironic was he'd gotten himself indicted on charges that
had nothing to fucking do with me.


221	EXT. MIAMI MANSION - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	221

ROCKY AOKI, Japanese, 50s, is led out in handcuffs by a MAN in an FBI windbreaker.

JORDAN (V.O.) Something about laundering drug money through offshore boat racing and a guy named Rocky Aoki, the founder of Benihana.

221A	INSERT BENI HANA COMMERCIAL --	221A

A smiling Rocky Aoki looks on as a HIBACHI CHEF expertly dices shrimp on a sizzling grill.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Beni-fucking-hana! Why would God be so cruel as to choose a chain of fucking Hibachi Restaurants to bring me down?


222	INT. SAUREL’S BEDROOM - DAY (OCT ‘95)	222

Saurel lays on the bed, smoking.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Long story short was Saurel ratted me out, but not before he ratted out Chantalle, who it turns out he’d been fucking every time she went to Switzerland!

Chantalle emerges from the bathroom naked. Laughing, she runs and jumps in bed with Saurel.


223	INT. FEDERAL COURT - QUEENS - DAY (SEP ‘98)	223

With his criminal attorney NOLAN DRAGER, 40s, next to him, Jordan stands before a JUDGE, being arraigned.

JORDAN (V.O.) I was indicted for money
laundering, securities fraud and an endless list of other shit.

HON. SAMANTHA STOGEL                * (leafing through a                           * subpoena)                                   *

The Judge bangs the gavel.

223B	INT. FEDERAL COURT LOBBY - DAY	2*23B

Jordan walks with Nolan Drager, who flips through the	* subpoena.	*

NOLAN DRAGER	* This is...well, it’s not good.	* It’s pretty bad actually. How	* much money do you have, Jordan?	*

JORDAN	* I can make bail.	*

NOLAN DRAGER	* I don’t mean the ten million, I	* mean for legal fees. Cuz if you	* want to fight this thing, it’s	* gonna be expensive. Like, sell-	* everything-you-own-expensive.	*


224	EXT. U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - DAY (SEP ‘98)	*224

Jordan exits the building. He’s fucked and he knows it. He sees beautiful Naomi waiting for him beside a limosine; life isn’t totally hopeless. He approaches.

JORDAN
Nay, thank God. I’m so glad you’re here.

They embrace. He can’t see her expression: she’d rather be anywhere else.

226	EXT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - POOL AREA - DAY (SEP ‘98)	226

ON SKYLAR AND PARKER, playing with a NANNY and Rocky the dog. Jordan watches them, sitting by his pool, drinking an O’Douls, weighing his options.

Donnie pops into the yard, in “Uncle Donnie” mode.

DONNIE
Hey, everybody! How’re the happiest people in Long Island? Hi, Rocky!!
(joining Jordan) Hate that fucking dog.

JORDAN
Tell me about it. It’s getting old, starting to shit inside the house again.

Jordan offers Donnie an O’Douls; Donnie declines.

DONNIE How you doing, brother? the food in jail?

JORDAN Lobster Newburg sucked. me some jewelry though.

How was



They gave

He shows off the electronic bracelet around his ankle.

DONNIE
Wonder if they got one in my size. Fuckin’ Rugrat, that wig-wearin’ hump. Tell you one thing: I’m never eating at Benihana’s again. Where’s Naomi?

JORDAN Inside. Pissed.

Donnie sees Naomi in a window. He waves but she barely registers him.

DONNIE What’s up her ass?

JORDAN
Had to mortgage the home to make bail. Probably gonna hafta sell it to pay my lawyers. If we fight this thing.

Donnie weighs that.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	124.


DONNIE
The Feds say anything about coming after the rest of us?

Jordan thinks, then shakes his head no.

DONNIE (CONT’D) You know, we’re all behind you. Everyone at the office.
(he removes an envelope, hands it to Jordan)
We bought back your mortgage. All the founding partners threw in a million apiece. Figured none of us would have it if it weren’t for you.

Jordan’s profoundly touched. Donnie squeezes his shoulder. A real moment of friendship.

DONNIE (CONT’D) You gotta fight this thing, baby.

Jordan nods.

JORDAN (V.O.) Like I said, loyalty meant a lot to me. Without your friends and
family standing behind you, you’re fucked.


226A	INT. U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY	2*26A (SEP ‘98)                                                   *

Jordan sits with Nolan Drager across from FBI Agent	* Denham, U.S. Attorney LUCAS SOLOMON, 50s, and Assistant	* U.S. Attorney ROCHELLE APPLEBAUM, 30s, humorless.	*

LUCAS SOLOMON	* There’s a term we have around	* here, we don’t like to use it	* often, only when circumstances	* dictate. It’s called a “Grenada.”	* Inspired by our government’s	* invasion in 1983 of the island	* nation of only 90,000 people,	* basically it stands for any case	* we get which is pretty much unlose-	* able. We could show up late and	* drunk to court, fuck up left-right-	* and-center and still we’d win.	* Mr. Belfort, you, sir, are a	* “Grenada.”	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	125.


ROCHELLE APPLEBAUM	* You’re looking at real prison	* time. Money laundering gets you	* as much as 20 years. Case	* couldn’t be stronger if we’d have	* caught you with your cash in your	* mattress.	*

Solomon pushes a box full of evidence across the table.	* Jordan eyeballs Denham.	*

LUCAS SOLOMON	* Read the discovery.	*

JORDAN	* That your life’s work in the box?	*

AGENT DENHAM	* Jordan, you rotting in jail til	* your kids’re outta college isn’t	* our ambition here. You weren’t	* the only one involved in all this.	* We think those folks deserve their	* day in court too.	*

NOLAN DRAGER	* Why do I get the sense there’s an
offer in the air? If so, let’s	* put it on the table.	*

LUCAS SOLOMON
Full cooperation. A comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire.

JORDAN You want me to rat?

LUCAS SOLOMON	* We want your cooperation in --	*

AGENT DENHAM	* Yes. We want you to rat.	*

230	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	230

JORDAN	* How was Christy’s party?	*

NAOMI	* It was fine.	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	126.


JORDAN	* Baby, I talked to the lawyers	* again today. I have some really	* great news. As it turns out you’re	* totally off the hook.	*

NAOMI	* I know that already.	*

JORDAN	* You never did anything wrong	* anyway, right? At the end of the	* day all they really want is for me	* to cooperate - that’s it.	* See, apparently, I know so much	* about what’s going on in the stock	* market that I could save the	* government years of heartache. But	* it get’s even better... You see,	* if I cooperate I’ll only have to	* serve four short years and any	* fine I’d have to pay wouldn’t be	* due til after I serve my sentence.	* We’ll still have plenty of money	* left over. The only thing that I	* was kind of upset about was the	* fact that I might have to give	* them information about my friends.	*

NAOMI	* Like you said, “There’s no friends	* on Wall Street”.	*

JORDAN	* But there’s a silver lining to	* that too... It turns out that all	* of ‘em are probably gonna	* cooperate too. So in the end, that	* won’t really be a factor.	*

NAOMI	* Well, that’s really good news,	* honey. I’m really happy for you.	*

JORDAN	* No, it’s good for both of us, Nay.	*

NAOMI	* Yeah, yeah.	*

JORDAN	* Make love to me baby. Make love to	* me nice and slow.	*

NAOMI	* No Jordan. Stop!	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	127.


230A	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS	2*30A

TIME CUT: Jordan is fucking Naomi. It’s the best he’s	* felt in days. While he’s lost in it, she’s lost interest, * going through the motions perfunctorily.	*

JORDAN	* I love you, Nay. I love you so	* much. I’ve loved you from the	* first time I saw you.	*

NAOMI	* Fuck you.	*

That stops him.	*

JORDAN	* What?	*

NAOMI	* I fucking hate you.	*

JORDAN	* What are you talking about?	*

NAOMI	* You don’t give a shit about how I	* feel. All you care about is	* yourself.	*

JORDAN	* That’s not true. What do you mean?	*

NAOMI	* You wanna fuck me? Fine. Fuck me	* hard like it’s the last time.	*

JORDAN	* Hold still. Why are you moving	* like that?	*

NAOMI	* Go ahead, fuck me!	*

JORDAN	* What are you doing baby?	*

NAOMI	* Cum for me. Cum for me, baby. Like	* it’s the last time.	*

JORDAN	* You want me to cum, baby?	*

NAOMI	* Yeah, cum for me baby, cum!	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	128.


After a beat... He cums. Jordan rolls off Naomi. They lie * in uncomfortable silence.	*

NAOMI (CONT’D)	* Jordan, that was the last time. I	* want a divorce.	*

JORDAN	* What are you talking about?	*

NAOMI	* I want a divorce.	*

JORDAN	* What? What are you talking about?	* Now? After we just made love?	*

NAOMI	* And I wanted to puke.	*

Naomi gets up.	*

NAOMI (CONT’D)	* I don’t love you anymore Jordan. I	* haven’t for a long time.	*

JORDAN	* You don’t love me? Isn’t that	* convenient. Now, you don’t love	* me? Now while I’m under federal	* indictment with a fucking bracelet	* around my ankle? Now, all of a	* sudden, you decide you don’t love	* me?	*

NAOMI	* Yes, that’s right.	*

JORDAN	* What kind of a person are you?	*

NAOMI	* You married me. This is how it’s	* gonna be. Listen Jordan. I’m	* taking custody of the kids. If you	* agree to the divorce right now, I	* will allow you visitation. Don’t	* try to fight it. It will save us	* both a lot of money and I have a	* feeling you’re gonna need it.	*

Naomi exits to the dressing room. Jordan gets up, follows * after her.	*

JORDAN	* I’ve got news for you. You’re not	* taking my kids.	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	129.


NAOMI	* I already spoke to my lawyer. He	* said even if you don’t get	* convicted I can still get custody.	*

JORDAN	* My lawyers are more powerful than	* yours. You’re not taking my kids!	* You vicious cunt!	*

Naomi slaps Jordan. Jordan hits her back and exits.	*

CUT TO: *


230B	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS	2*30B

Jordan grabs a pair of scissors and starts slashing the	* couch. He retrieves a stash of coke from the couch	* lining. Naomi enters the hallway as Jordan snorts coke.	*

NAOMI	* Look at yourself Jordan. You’re	* sick, you’re a sick man.	*

JORDAN	* You’re not taking my kids.	*

NAOMI	* You think I’d let my kids near	* you? Look at you. You know what my	* lawyers said? You’re going to jail	* for twenty years. Twenty fucking	* years, Jordan. You’ll be lucky if	* you ever see them again.	*

JORDAN	* Oh yeah? You don’t think I’m gonna	* see my kids again? Oh yeah?	*

Jordan heads towards Skylar’s room. She tries to stop	* Jordan. He knocks her to the ground.	*

Jordan charges towards Skylar’s room.	*

Jordan exiting Skylar’s room with Skylar crying in his	* arms. Naomi starts to pull herself up from off the floor	* as Jordan races toward the stairs.	*

Jordan putting Skylar in the car.	*

Naomi and Violet desperately try to open the garage door. *

Naomi races into the garage. Jordan gets in the drivers	* seat, locks the doors and starts the engine.	*

Naomi begs him to stop. Violet presses the garage door	* button. Naomi grabs a tool and smashes the driver side	* window.	*

Jordan sees the door closing - he thinks “fuck it” -	* slams into reverse, crashing through the garage door. Car * continues in reverse, crashing into a concrete pillar.	*

Naomi and Violet rush to the car, pull Skylar out and	* bring her inside the house. Jordan sits as blood rushes	* down his face.	*

OFF A “COOPERATION AGREEMENT,” we find --	*

-- Nolan Drager, Lucas Solomon, Rochelle Applebaum and	* Agent Denham all back at the conference table, reading	* copies of the same contract. Lucas does so aloud:	*

LUCAS SOLOMON	* Paragraph 2. The defendant shall	* provide information regarding all	* criminal activities of the	* defendant and others from June	* 1st, 1990, onwards. Paragraph 3.	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	131.

The defendant shall participate in	* undercover activities pursuant to	* the instructions of the FBI,	* including wearing a recording	* device, also known as a ‘wire’, in	* conjunction with the investigation	* of securities fraud. Paragraph 4.	* The defendant must not commit, or	* attempt to commit, any further	* crimes.	*

Jordan’s here, too, looking miserable. He stops Lucas.	*

JORDAN	* Lemme just sign the fucking thing.	*

He signs the fucking thing.	*


230G	INT. U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY	2*30G

Jordan sits alone, finishes writing a long list of names on a yellow legal pad.

JORDAN (V.O.)
For the next six hours, I came up with a list. Friends, enemies, business associates, anybody who’d ever known me or taken so much as a stock tip. The first name on the list was Donnie’s.

And as Jordan heaves a huge sigh, we’re suddenly...


231	INT. FBI OFFICE - DAY (OCT ‘98)	231

Agent Denham tapes a recorder to Jordan’s inner thigh,
runs a microphone wire up his chest. Agent Hughes	* watches.	*

AGENT DENHAM
Talk normally, breathe normally, within five minutes you’ll forget you even have it on.

Jordan nods, buttons up his shirt.


232	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (OCT ‘98)	232

Wearing a suit and tie, Jordan walks in to the bullpen, where the Brokers spot him, giving him a standing ovation. He forces a smile, waves to the crowd.

As Robbie and Chester Ming look on, Jordan forces a smile as he approaches Donnie, who gives him a hug.

233	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	233

Jordan and Donnie sit at the coffee table over takeout sushi.

JORDAN
The trial won’t be for months, so obviously I’ll be counting on you to pick up the slack.

DONNIE
Whatever you need, bro. You know that.

Jordan reaches in his jacket for a yellow slip of PAPER.

JORDAN
And you know how much that means to me. Hey, you know what I wanted to ask you?

Jordan catches Donnie’s eye, pushes the PAPER over in front of him.

JORDAN (CONT’D) The Steve Madden deal, did he ever come through on that?

Donnie looks down at the paper, reads Jordan’s writing:

“DON’T INCRIMINATE YOURSELF. I’M WEARING A WIRE.”

JORDAN (CONT’D) Remember he was supposed to kick back like four mil from that one account?

DONNIE
Uh... tell you the truth I was so fucked up, I don’t really remember anything about that.

Donnie slips the paper in his jacket, gives Jordan a look -- “Thank you.” Jordan nods.

JORDAN
Well if you talk to him, let me know. You want the last yellowtail?

DONNIE Why not?

JORDAN (V.O.) And thus began my career as a government cooperator. I was a rat...

234	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (NOV ‘98)	234

Jordan lays alone, asleep in bed. We hear the DOORBELL.

JORDAN (V.O.) But I wasn’t losing any sleep over it.

After a few beats, Violet knocks, enters. Jordan stirs.

VIOLET
I’m sorry, Mr. Jordan. You got a visitor.

JORDAN Why? What’s going on?

AGENT DENHAM You’re going to jail.

Agent Denham holds up the slip of yellow paper that Jordan gave to Donnie. And on Jordan’s look...

JORDAN (V.O.) Donnie Azoff, my partner. My best friend.

Sentencing. Jordan’s mother is there, tears in her eyes. *

NOLAN DRAGER	* I hope your Honor would agree that	* Mr. Belfort has distinguished	* himself in terms of his	* cooperation in this white collar	* fraud.

HON. RAYMOND SAMITZ	* The sentence of the court shall be	* 48 months in Federal Prison.	*

CLOSE ON DENHAM, reading a New York Times article on Jordan’s sentencing. He looks satisfied with his accomplishment, until he looks up...

246	INT. PRISON VAN - DAY (MAR ‘99)	246

Jordan rides in back, stares out the window, thinking about all he’s done. The van stops as it arrives at the PRISON GATE.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I’m not ashamed to admit, when we arrived to prison, I was absolutely terrified...

GUARD (O.S.) Belfort! Fuckin’ move!

Jordan leaps to his feet.

JORDAN (V.O.) I needn’t have been.


247	EXT. MINIMUM C PRISON - DAY (SPRING 2000)	247

A tennis ball hits pavement and WE PAN UP TO JORDAN, in prison fatigues but playing doubles with three other PRISONERS, all white middle-aged EXECUTIVE TYPES.

JORDAN
Sorry, just out. What is that, forty-thirty?

As the game continues, Jordan serving, the CAMERA PULLS UP TO SEE THE WHOLE PRISON YARD: one group of inmates does Tai Chi while another has formed a book club.

JORDAN (V.O.)
For a brief, fleeting moment, I’d forgotten I was rich and lived in America.

BLACK OUT.


248	INT. HOTEL BANQUET HALL - EARLY 2000’S - DAY	*248

MEXICAN KID	* Choosing what is good from him and	* being a millionaire.	*

Two hundred people attend Jordan’s “Straight Line	* Persuasion” seminar, watching a massive screen (on which	* these KIDS have appeared).	*

ON-SCREEN: THE “JB” LOGO APPEARS, FOLLOWED BY CLIPS OF	* JORDAN giving seminars in different locations (see	* addendum below), edited in with footage of looming	* economic uncertainties.	*

Then: a MAN WITH A MIC steps out...	*

MAN WITH A MIC	* Ladies and gentlemen, please join	* me in welcoming to Auckland, New	* Zealand... Mr. Jordan Belfort!	*

BIG APPLAUSE as Jordan takes the stage, waving. This	* might go on a while. If so, there COULD be TITLES:	*

Jordan Belfort spent 22 months in federal prison	* and paid $100,000,000 in fines.	*

THEN:	*

His cellmate was, no fucking joke, Tommy Chong.	*

THEN:	*

Since his release, he’s become a multi-millionaire again * as a motivational speaker.	*

When the applause finally dies down...	*

...Jordan doesn’t speak. Instead he walks down to the	* front row of his audience, studying faces. He picks one. * Takes a pen from his coat and offers it to him.	*

JORDAN	* Sell me this pen.	*

The Kiwi, embarrassed, takes a moment, then:	*

KIWI IN AUDIENCE	* Well, it’s a good pen, it’s a	* ballpoint --	*

Jordan takes the pen back with a smile. Hands it to the	* next person.	*

JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)	* Sell me this pen...Sell me this	* pen... Sell me this pen...Sell me	* this pen...	*

안 하던 화장도 진하게
안 가던 클럽도 가네 huh
왜 자꾸 신경이 쓰이는지 웃어
넘기려고 했는데
웃음이 나오질 않네
언제부터였는지
니가 날 갖고 놀았던 게
정말 진심이었는지
어떻게 니가 이럴 수 있어
어쩐지 요즘 들어서
많이 달라졌다 했어
그런 줄도 모르고 oh
너만 사랑했어
내가 이럴 줄 알았어 uh
니가 그 남잘 만나러 간다고 했을 때
왜 널 그때 붙잡지 못했을까
이럴 줄 알았어 uh
모르는 전화번호가 뜰 때부터
그때부터 이럴 줄 알았어
자기야 의심하는 게 아냐
내 맘 알지
널 너무 사랑해서
그래 그러니까 잠시만
핸드폰 좀 줘 봐 확인할 게 있어서
그래 비밀번호는 또 언제 바꿔놨니
통화 목록이 왜 이리 깨끗한 걸까
멍청하게 전부 다 지워버렸구나
Ha 귀엽네 우리 아가
너 많이 이상해 솔직히 말해
나 좀 화나려고 해
넌 왜 날 떠나갔어
이런 내가 지겨워졌어
전화긴 왜 꺼져 있어
나 지금 할 말이 있는데
목소리만 듣고서
그냥 집에 돌아갈게
기다릴게 여기서 니 집 문 앞에서
내가 이럴 줄 알았어 uh
니가 그 남잘 만나러 간다고 했을 때
왜 널 그때 붙잡지 못했을까
이럴 줄 알았어 uh
모르는 전화번호가 뜰 때부터
그때부터 이럴 줄 알았어
내가 뭘 잘못했어
생각해보면 내가 잘못한 건
하나 없는 것 같은데
솔직하게 말해줘
솔직하게 말하지 않아도
이미 다 알고 있긴 해
그래 이제 정말 그만할게
죽어도 참기 힘들면 말해
Baby please
정말 마지막으로 한 마디만 할게
그때 그 사람 아니
그때 그 놈이 맞지
잘생기긴 했던데 그리 듬직해
보이진 않던데 말야
네가 무슨 잘못이니
너무 착한 게 죄라면
그거 하나뿐이지
네 옆에 내가 있는걸 알았을 텐데
내가 참 우스워 보였나 봐 그 자식
끊지 마 자기야
물어볼게 있어서 그래
어 여기 어디쯤이
그 놈 집이 맞지
내가 이럴 줄 알았어 uh
니가 그 남잘 만나러 간다고 했을 때
왜 널 그때 붙잡지 못했을까
이럴 줄 알았어 uh
모르는 전화번호가 뜰 때부터
그때부터 이럴 줄 알았어You might also likeEmbedFalling Lyrics[존박 "Falling" 가사]

[Verse 1]
하얗게 번지는 머릿속에다
그대를 새겨놓고 저 멀리 날아가
모든 게 보이는 두 눈을 감고서
시간을 되돌려서
그 때로 돌아가고 싶어

[Chorus]
Falling 이대로 falling for you
날 잡아줄 수 없어도
Falling 또 다시 falling for you
날 감싸줄 수 없나요
[Verse 2]
좋았던 나날도 너무 아팠던 날도
이제 돌이켜보면 그저 그랬었나요
아니라 말해요 멍든 가슴도
멍해진 내 마음도
다시 느낄 수만 있다면

[Chorus]
Falling 이대로 falling for you
날 잡아줄 수 없어도
Falling 또 다시 falling for you
날 감싸줄 수 없나요

[Verse 3]
까맣게 번지는 하늘 위에서
한없이 추락하는 날 보고만 있네요

[Chorus]
Falling 이대로 falling for you
이런 날 잡아 주세요
Falling 또 다시 falling for you
제발 날 감싸 주세요

[Outro]
한없이 추락하더라도
바닥까지 떨어져도
그댈 향해 난 falling for you
그저 그대만 보네요You might also likeEmbedShe`s Gone LyricsGi-reul keo-reul-ttaen i norael deu-reumyeon one love

Mmh, yeah, Sierra-Lima-India-Mike-Kilo-Alpha
Tunnel vision, neuf juice, han, yo, wow, wow
Tu connais, l'équipe ne bouge pas
Han, yeah, wow, han

[Couplet 1 : Slimka]
C'est moi l'enfant du peuple, j'suis dans la tête des jeunes
J'suis dans la tête des vieux aussi, sans forcer, c'est naturel
C'est moi qui crée l'mouvement, c'est moi qui crée la vague
Depuis tout petit j'ai appris à partager mon assiette
J'respecte pas trop les bâtards qui osent oublier leurs reu-fré
Pour du [plomo, plata ?], en quelques s'condes peuvent t'la mettre
Ce n'est pas leurs vies mais ils veulent jouer les bandits
J'préfère rester à ma place, petit bédo et cannette
Jeune métisse donne d'la force à toute la ville, tu l'sais
Des quartiers nord aux sud, même de l'est à l'ouest
J'ai bien grandi, j'ai passé l'âge d'insulter les femmes
J'ai du respect pour toutes les daronnes qui s'battent corps et âme pour l'avenir de leurs enfants
Maman, I love you, on s'connait bientôt d'puis trente ans
Cassim a grandi, Cassim déborde de temps en temps
Mais j'reste focus, j'reste dans ma tunnel vision
Concentré, je prends toujours les bonnes décisions, han
[Pont : Salaam]
Hey, hey, wolu-wolu, han, han, han, hey, hey, ouais, hey

[Couplet 2 : Salaam]
J'bois du rhum âgé avec une rom âgée
Pas l'temps d'jouer le [chromagé ?]
Du cheese à faire comme un fromager
C'est la West Coast dans les potagers
La taupe peut t'prendre en otage
Et bellek à c'que ton pote ingère
J'l'ai vu pop un ["G" ? à 1:14] j'ai les neurones H.S, le fond endommagé
J'vomis un seize, y a aucun mot mâché
Même si j'découpe des têtes comme monarchie
Et vise dans l'mille comme bon archer
J'suis un enfant d'ma ville
Mais elle aime pas voir ses mômes marcher (Han)
J'reste dans ma shit, j'cherche les dollars, les shekels (Cash)
Pas écolo mais j'prône la sauvegarde des espèces
J'croise des clochards, des préfets, des Honda, des Bentley
On connaît l'chômage, les vraies payes
Après l'cauchemar c'est l'réveil, yo
Des costards, des TN, des grosses liasses, des piécettes
Des bons gars et des traîtres, des mogwais et des gremlins
Le spotlight, les ténèbres, la bonne année des 'teilles
Ça m'rappelle l'époque où on traînait entre molards et Bel-Air (Han)
Tout l'quartier sous les yeux, les [verges ? à 1:42], les tiens, les deux
Zéro, five, vingt-deux, y a qu'dans nos poches qu'on aime les bleus
Son tarpé est moelleux, on jouait mais c'est plus un jeu
Dans la pièce c'est nuageux, le morceau est vénéneux, hey

Des fantômes dans ma tête, dans ses bzez du silicone
J'suis en dessus comme un drone
J'suis une tempête, un cyclone
J'suis du filtré, t'es du jaune
J'suis en dessus comme un drone
Et tu " comme Gollum, m'trouver dans l'marécage, la zone
Ils sont drôles, ils pleurnichent comme des joueurs de football
Moi, il m'faut un baveux comme Saul
Toi joues pas avec le feu, c'est la punition qu'tu frôles
Quand j'étais p'tit, j'aimais pas les épinards
Pour ça qu'j'ai pas assez d'force pour en donner à ces pleurnichards
Tous des ringards, ils s'prennent en photo devant l'miroir
Des fantômes dans ma tête, du silicone dans ses nibards
Elle est passée sur l'billard, j'suis passé par l'boulevard
Du quartier j'suis passé, j'ai un gros salaire sur l'poignet
Que Dieu m'pardonne, elle est chargée la vago
J'dois boire de l'eau bénite, pas un latte macchiato
Pourquoi tu fais l'boss ? T'as pas l'passé à Pablo

Le rap s'est pas fermé du cul, han, dis le moi si t'es maton
C'est pas pour les débilos, les 'lauds et les fans de Migos qui causent
Dans ce rap, y a mon flow qui tourne, normal, je suis fier de mes gosses, yeah
J'sers un couplet, j'sors, j'écoute, je kiffe
Si la balle n'a pas touché la cible, j'retourne, je tire
C'est la moindre des choses, j'suis toujours vrai, même si j'fais gaffe
Y a pas d'guten tag, je fais le taff, [? à 4:32] le staff, hein
Cérémonie aux côtés d'un groupe de rock, connu dans toute l'Europe
Photographes à six pour une petite pic' légendaire, deux secondes et mon X est en l'air
Sont plus connus qu'moi mais attends qu'je drop mais même connu, je mettrais pas d'robe
J'veux jamais entendre "Si si patrón", j'suis aussi issu d'l'inmigración
Ha, ils sont sur le macadam, bloqués

Ok, t'es naze, t'as rien à donner

Des fois c'est louche quand ta nana elle s'plaint
Pas d'espoir à avoir, faut juste ramasser l'pain, yeah
Chaussettes italiennes, mhh, et une veste d'alien
Elle, c'est pas ta lionne, bitch, c'est une Thee Stallion
Mon flow il est al, mon squad ils est 'auch
C'est comme un fleuve d'eau minérale
Mon troisième œil, c'est ma glande pinéale
Merde, flemme d'être le gendre idéal

Wouh, Let's get it, wow
Yeah, ok

[Couplet 3 : Bobby Facile]
Du sang d'grenat dans les veines, eh
On suis pas l'championnat mais on est tous pour Servette
J'pourrais faire le tour de la ville à l'envers
By-bo, faut qu'on m'enterre dans l'périmètre, eh
Les années passent, j'change pas de veste
J'développe mon net, j'aiguise mon flair
J'ai mis d'l'ordre dans mes affaires
Préserver l'casier judiciaire
Réinitialiser les paramètres
Maintenant j'fais gaffe quand j'ouvre une f'nêtre
Sur ma tête, j'connais mieux la rue que c'putain d'internet
Garçon, la prudence est d'rigueur
T'avise pas d'traîner dans mon viseur
Vide la caisse fissa, fissa, embarque même le téléviseur
On fait la pluie, le beau temps et on donne l'heure
La police c'est des emmerdes, les iencli c'est du bonheur
Les p'tits frères seuls, les p'tites sœurs
Comme si ils avaient pas d'mère
Ça parle beaucoup mais y a ni bénéf' ni salaire
Le rap, le cinéma, tout ça t'as rendu paro
Tu sais plus si t'es dans Scarface ou dans Naruto
Puto, n'essaie pas la fois de trop
Cherche pas à connaître mes défauts
T'inquiète, on fera c'qu'il faut
Ça prendra le temps qu'il faut
Par nous, pour nous, pour les autres
La ville est belle, la ville est nôtre
J'suis un numéro vingt-trois qui saute
Toujours dans l'sens d'ces idéaux, ow, ow

[Pont : Azi]
Haaan, han

Ramène pas ta gueule, ramène pas ton bec
T'inquiète pas pour moi, moi ça gère la tech'
C'est comme d'habitude, tu viens, tu saoules les gens
Ouais j'donne des leçons , c'est tonton A-Z
L'autre il fait du bruit, à part ça, rien du tout
Ça fait grave du cash, à part ça, rien du tout
Plus l'temps pour les dix, minimum quatre-vingts
Ce qui justifie les moyens c'est la faim
J'suis dans l'Audi noire, ou bien dans la Merco
J'rappe le drapeau noir avec la tête de mort
Ils ont rien trouvé, j'ai mis tout dans l'frigo
Tu veux être mon frère mais t'es pas vérifié
Personne perd ici, on est gang ici
On a grandi là, j'vais pas mourir ici
Personne perd ici, que du bénéfice
On a grandi là, j'vais pas mourir ici
Quand j'regarde les autres, on dirait j'suis aux States
Quand j'fume trop de jaune, ça monte vite à la tête
On est plus que trois-quatre, on était dix-sept
Raconte pas d'la merde, check qui tire les ficelles
J'suis dans l'périmètre, devant le carrefour
Elle m'a vu, elle attend qu'j'lui fasse la cour
Elle croit qu'elle c'est Aaliyah et moi Shakur
Les iencli, un par un, chacun son tour
J'suis dans l'hôtel, la chambre deux cent quarante-sept
J'vais rouler la batte, arrête de fumer l'cul
J'vais rouler la batte, arrête de fumer l'cul
Il pourrait fumer son doigt si y a plus la quête
Merci pour l'soutien, ["maintenant l'p'tit reuf" ? à 7:37] il sort
Les autres c'est des chiens mais y a personne qui mord
Nous y a que des loups, la Lune me rend plus fort
La concu' y a pas, l'ancien m'a dit : "Maintenant tu les tords"

Jamais d'roue d'secours, en mode plan A, jamais de plan B
Eh fils de p', m'appelle pas Mario, moi j'suis pas plombier
Ni pompier, tes ailes ont poussé, mais elles vont s'faire plomber
La Reine des neiges, elle a l'nez plâtré, j'traîne pas dans plan C
Y a qu'devant Dieu que mon corps oblique prend une forme en biais
Y a qu'chez nous qu'tu peux voir des manchots partir menottes aux pieds
Parle pas à ma femme, elle découpe comme Princesse Mononoké
J'traîne avec Isaiah, jamais il chantera "Papaoutai"
Moi j'les aime comme viande panée
J'rappais, t'étais même pas né
J'cueille des MC's facilement parce qu'ils trainent tous dans l'même panier
Des gens t'f'ront la guerre, vous avez grandit sur les mêmes paliers
Très peu d'place en Suisse, alors certains s'accrochent aux ["escaliers" ? à 8:41]
J'suis pas concierge mais j'rentre dans l'bâtiment avec le double des clés
Mes démons me retiennent, mais qu'est-c'qui s'passerait si j'me laisse aller ?
Vas-y vite, roule un jet, on va s'gaver, y a escale
Les seules fois où les gens te poussent, c'est dans l'vide ou les esclaliers
Bah ouais ma gueule, qu'est-c'tu veux qui m'arrive ?
J'marche sous un umbrella
Oh la la, moi j'passe le salaam à mes Rabesha

Pourquoi bek bek quand tu sais qu't'as badé
Un défaite c'est mieux qu'égalité, selon oim
C'est bien mieux d'voir les choses sur le long terme
Vivre le présent en pensant à l'avenir
Avec alégresse, tout en restant ferme

허나 내 맘까지 접은건 아냐EmbedA VIsion of Noble Things LyricsHe slept but for an hour or two, and even then with such disturbance of fitful dreams that he could not be said to rest. At the earliest sound of movements in the house he rose and went out into the morning air. There had fallen a heavy shower just after sunrise, and the glory of the east was still partly veiled with uncertain clouds. Heedless of weather-signs, Sidney strode away at a great pace, urged by his ungovernable thoughts. His state was that miserable one in which a man repeats for the thousandth time something he has said, and torments himself with devising possible and impossible interpretations thereof. Through the night he had done nothing but imagine what significance Jane might have attached to his words about Clara Hewett. Why had he spoken of Clara at all? One moment he understood his reasons, and approved them; the next he was at a loss to account for such needless revival of a miserable story. How had Jane interpreted him? And was it right or wrong to have paused when on the point of confessing that he loved her?

Rain caught him at a distance from home, and he returned to breakfast in rather a cheerless plight. He found that Michael was not feeling quite himself, and would not rise till midday. Jane had a look of anxiety, and he fancied she behaved to him with a constraint hitherto unknown. The fancy was dispelled, however, when, later in the morning, she persuaded him to bring out his sketch-book, and suggested points of view for a drawing of the farm that had been promised to Mr. Pammenter. Himself unable to recover the tone of calm intimacy which till yesterday had been natural between them, Sidney found himself studying the girl, seeking to surprise some proof that she too was no longer the same, and only affected this unconsciousness of change. There was, perhaps, a little less readiness in her eyes to meet his, but she talked as naturally as ever, and the spontaneousness of her good-humour was assuredly not feigned.

On Monday the farmer had business in Maldon. Occasionally when he drove over to that town he took one or other of his children with him to visit a relative, and to-day he proposed that Jane should be of the party. They started after an early dinner. Michael and Sidney stood together in the road, watching the vehicle as it rolled away; then they walked in silence to a familiar spot where they could sit in shadow. Sidney was glad of Jane's departure for the afternoon. He found it impossible to escape the restlessness into which he had fallen, and was resolved to seek relief by opening his mind to the old man. There could be little doubt that Michael already understood his thoughts, and no better opportunity for such a conversation was likely to present itself. When they had been seated for a minute or two, neither speaking, Sidney turned to his companion with a grave look. At the same instant Michael also had raised his eyes and seemed on the point of saying something of importance. They regarded each other. The old man’s face was set in an expression of profound feeling, and his lips moved tremulously before words rose to them.

‘What were you going to say, Sidney?' he asked, reading the other's features.

‘Something which I hope won’t be displeasing to you. I was going to speak of Jane. Since she has been living with you she has grown from a child to a woman. When I was talking with her in the garden on Saturday night I felt this change more distinctly than I had ever done before. I understood that it had made a change in myself. I love her, Mr. Snowdon, and it's my dearest hope that she may come to feel the same for me.'

Michael was more agitated than the speaker; he raised a hand to his forehead and closed his eyes as if the light pained them. But the smile with which he speedily answered Sidney's look of trouble was full of reassurance.
‘You couldn't have said anything that would give me more pleasure,' he replied, just above his breath. ‘Does she know it? Did you speak to her?'

‘We were talking of years ago, and I mentioned Clara Hewett. I said that I had forgotten all about her except that she'd befriended Jane. But nothing more than that. I couldn’t say what I was feeling just then. Partly I thought that it was right to speak to you first; and then—it seemed to me almost as if I should be treating her unfairly. I’m so much older—she knows that it isn't the first time I—and she’s always thought of me just as a friend.'

‘So much older?' repeated Michael, with a grave smile. ‘Why, you're both children to my sight. Wait and let me think a bit, Sidney. I too have something I want to say. I’m glad you've spoken this afternoon, when there's time for us to talk. Just wait a few minutes, and let me think.'

Sidney had as good as forgotten that there was anything unusual in his friend's circumstances; this last day or two he had thought of nothing but Jane and his love for her. Now he recalled the anticipation—originating he scarcely knew how—that some kind of disclosure would before long be made to him. The trouble of his mind was heightened; he waited with all but dread for the next words.

‘I think I've told you,' Michael resumed at length, steadying his voice, ‘that Joseph is my youngest son, and that I had three others. Three others: Michael, Edward, and Robert—all dead. Edward died when he was a boy of fifteen; Robert was killed on the railway—he was a porter—at three-and-twenty. The eldest went out to Australia; he took a wife there, and had one child; the wife died when they'd been married a year or two, and Michael and his boy were drowned, both together. I was living with them at the time, as you know. But what I've never spoken of, Sidney, is that my son had made his fortune. He left a deal of land, and many thousands of pounds, behind him. There was no finding any will; a lawyer in the nearest town, a man that had known him a long time, said he felt sure there'd been no will made. So, as things were, the law gave everything to his father.'

He related it with subdued voice, in a solemn and agitated tone. The effect of the news upon Sidney was a painful constriction of the heart, a rush of confused thought, an involvement of all his perceptions in a sense of fear. The pallor of his cheeks and the pained parting of his lips bore witness to how little he was prepared for such a story.

‘I've begun with what ought by rights to have come last,' pursued Michael, after drawing a deep sigh. ‘But it does me good to get it told; it's been burdening me this long while. Now you must listen, Sidney, whilst I show you why I've kept this a secret. I've no fear but you'll understand me, though most people wouldn't. It's a secret from everybody except a lawyer in London, who does business for me; a right-hearted man he is, in most things, and I'm glad I met with him, but he doesn't understand me as you will; he thinks I'm making a mistake. My son knows nothing about it; at least, it's my hope and belief he doesn't. He told me he hadn't heard of his brother's death. I say I hope he doesn't know; it isn't selfishness, that; I needn't tell you. I've never for a minute thought of myself as a rich man, Sidney; I've never thought of the money as my own, never; and if Joseph proves himself honest, I'm ready to give up to him the share of his brother's property that it seems to me ought to be rightly his, though the law for some reason looks at it in a different way. I'm ready, but I must know that he's an honest man; I must prove him first.'

The eagerness of his thought impelled him to repetitions and emphasis. His voice fell upon a note of feebleness, and with an effort he recovered the tone in which he had begun.

‘As soon as I knew that all this wealth had fallen to me I decided at once to come back to England. What could I do out there? I decided to come to England, but I couldn't see farther ahead than that. I sold all the land; I had the business done for me by that lawyer I spoke of, that had known my son, and he recommended me to a Mr. Percival in London. I came back, and I found little Jane, and then bit by bit I began to understand what my duty was. It got clear in my mind; I formed a purpose, a plan, and it's as strong in me now as ever. Let me think again for a little, Sidney. I want to make it as plain to you as it is to me. You'll understand me best if I go back and tell you more than I have done yet about my life before I left England. Let me think a while.'

He was overcome with a fear that he might not be able to convey with sufficient force the design which had wholly possessed him. So painful was the struggle in him between enthusiasm and a consciousness of failing faculties, that Sidney grasped his hand and begged him to speak simply, without effort.

‘Have no fear about my understanding you. We've talked a great deal together, and I know very well what your strongest motives are. Trust me to sympathise with you.'

‘I do! If I hadn't that trust, Sidney, I couldn't have felt the joy I did when you spoke to me of my Jane. You'll help me to carry out my plan; you and Jane will; you and Jane! I've got to be such an old man all at once, as it seems, and I dursn't have waited much longer without telling you what I had in my mind. See now, I'll go back to when I was a boy, as far back as I can remember. You know I was born in Clerkenwell, and I've told you a little now and then of the hard times I went through. My poor father and mother came out of the country, thinking to better themselves; instead of that, they found nothing but cold and hunger, and toil and moil. They were both dead by when I was between thirteen and fourteen. They died in the same winter—a cruel winter. I used to go about begging bits of firewood from the neighbours. There was a man in our house who kept dogs, and I remember once catching hold of a bit of dirty meat—I can't call it meat—that one of them had gnawed and left on the stairs; and I ate it, as if I'd been a dog myself, I was that driven with hunger. Why, I feel the cold and the hunger at this minute! It was a cruel winter, that, and it left me alone. I had to get my own living as best I could.

‘No teaching. I was nineteen before I could read the signs over shops, or write my own name. Between nineteen and twenty I got all the education I ever was to have, paying a man with what I could save out of my earnings. The blessing was I had health and strength, and with hard struggling I got into a regular employment. At five-and-twenty I could earn my pound a week, pretty certain. When it got to five shillings more, I must needs have a wife to share it with me. My poor girl came to live with me in a room in Hill Street.
I've never spoken to you of her, but you shall hear it all now, cost me what it may in the telling. Of course she was out of a poor home, and she'd known as well as me what it was to go cold and hungry. I sometimes think, Sidney, I can see a look of her in Jane's face—but she was prettier than Jane; yes, yes, prettier than Jane. And to think a man could treat a poor little thing like her the way I did!—you don't know what sort of a man Michael Snowdon was then; no, you don't know what I was then. You're not to think I ill-used her in the common way; I never raised my hand, thank God! and I never spoke a word a man should be ashamed of. But I was a hard, self-willed, stubborn fool. How she came to like me and to marry me, I don't know; we were so different in every way. Well, it was partly my nature and partly what I'd gone through; we hadn't been married more than a month or two when I began to find fault with her, and from that day on she could never please me. I earned five-and-twenty shillings a week, and I'd made up my mind that we must save out of it. I wouldn't let her work; no, what she had to do was to keep the home on as little as possible, and always have everything clean and straight when I got back at night. But Jenny hadn't the same ideas about things as I had. She couldn't pinch and pare, and our plans of saving came to nothing. It grew worse as the children were born. The more need there was for carefulness, the more heedless Jenny seemed to get. And it was my fault, mine from beginning to end. Another man would have been gentle with her and showed her kindly when she was wrong, and have been thankful for the love she gave him, whatever her faults. That wasn't my way. I got angry, and made her life a burden to her. I must have things done exactly as I wished; if not, there was no end to my fault-finding. And yet, if you'll believe it, I loved my wife as truly as man ever did. Jenny couldn't understand that—and how should she? At last she began to deceive me in all sorts of little things; she got into debt with shop-people, she showed me false accounts, she pawned things without my knowing. Last of all, she began to drink. Our fourth child was born just at that time; Jenny had a bad illness, and I believe it set her mind wrong. I lost all control of her, and she used to say if it wasn't for the children she'd go and leave me. One morning we quarrelled very badly, and I did as I'd threatened to—I walked about the streets all the night that followed, never coming home. I went to work next day, but at dinner-time I got frightened and ran home just to speak a word. Little Mike, the eldest, was playing on the stairs, and he said his mother was asleep. I went into the room, and saw Jenny lying on the bed dressed. There was something queer in the way her arms were stretched out. When I got near I saw she was dead. She'd taken poison.

‘And it was I had killed her, just as much as if I'd put the poison to her lips. All because I thought myself such a wise fellow, because I'd resolved to live more prudently than other men of my kind did. I wanted to save money for the future—out of five-and-twenty shillings a week. Many and many a day I starved myself to try and make up for expenses of the home. Sidney, you remember that man we once went to hear lecture, the man that talked of nothing but the thriftlessness of the poor, and how it was their own fault they suffered? I was very near telling you my story when we came away that night. Why, look; I myself was just the kind of poor man that would have suited that lecturer. And what came of it? If I'd let my poor Jenny go her own way from the first, we should have had hard times now and then, but there'd have been our love to help us, and we should have been happy enough. They talk about thriftiness, and it just means that poor people are expected to practise a self-denial that the rich can't even imagine, much less carry out. You know now why this kind of talk always angers me.'

Michael brooded for a few moments, his eyes straying sadly over the landscape before him.

‘I was punished,' he continued, ‘and in the fittest way. The two of my boys who showed most love for me, Edward and Robert, died young. The eldest and youngest were a constant trouble to me. Michael was quick-tempered and self-willed, like myself; I took the wrong way with him, just like I had with his mother, and there was no peace till he left home. Joseph was still harder to deal with; but he's the only one left alive, and there is no need to bring up things against him. With him I wasn't to blame, unless I treated him too kindly and spoilt him. He was my favourite, was Jo, and he repaid me cruelly. When he married, I only heard of it from other people; we'd been parted for a long time already. And just about then I had a letter from Michael, asking me if I was willing to go out and live with him in Australia. I hadn't heard from him more than two or three times in twelve years, and when this letter came to me I was living in Sheffield; I'd been there about five years. He wrote to say he was doing well, and that he didn't like to think of me being left to spend my old age alone. It was a kind letter, and it warmed my heart. Lonely I was; as lonely and sorrowful a man as any in England. I wrote back to say that I'd come to him gladly if he could promise to put me in the way of earning my own living. He agreed to that, and I left the old country, little thinking I should ever see it again. I didn't see Joseph before I went. All I knew of him was, that he lived in Clerkenwell Close, married; and that was all I had to guide me when I tried to find him a few years after. I was bitter against him, and went without trying to say good-bye.

‘My son's fortune seems to have been made chiefly out of horse-dealing and what they call “land-grabbing”—buying sheep-runs over the heads of squatters, to be bought out again at a high profit. Well, you know what my opinion is of trading at the best, and as far as I could understand it, it was trading at about its worst that had filled Michael's pockets. He'd had a partner for a time, and very ugly stories were told me about the man. However, Michael gave me as kind a welcome as his letter promised; prosperity had done him good, and he seemed only anxious to make up for the years of unkindness that had gone by. Had I been willing, I might have lived under his roof at my ease; but I held him to his bargain, and worked like any other man who goes there without money. It's a comfort to me to think of those few years spent in quiet and goodwill with my eldest boy. His own lad would have given trouble, I'm afraid, if he'd lived; Michael used to talk to me uneasily about him, poor fellow! But they both came to their end before the world had parted them.

‘If I'd been a young man, I dare say I should have felt different when they told me how rich I was; it gave me no pleasure at first, and when I'd had time to think about it I only grew worried. I even thought once or twice of getting rid of the burden by giving all the money to a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne. But then I remembered that the poor in the old country had more claim on me, and when I'd got used to the idea of being a wealthy man, I found myself recalling all sorts of fancies and wishes that used to come into my head when I was working hard for a poor living. It took some time to get all the lawyer's business finished, and by when it was done I began to see a way before me. First of all I must find my son in England, and see if he needed help. I hadn't made any change in my way of living, and I came back from Australia as a steerage passenger, wearing the same clothes that I'd worked in. The lawyer laughed at me, but I'm sure I should have laughed at myself if I'd dressed up as a gentleman and begun to play the fool in my old age. The money wasn't to be used in that way. I'd got my ideas, and they grew clearer during the voyage home.

‘You know how I found Jane. Not long after, I put an advertisement in the papers, asking my son, if he saw it, to communicate with Mr. Percival—that's the lawyer I was recommended to in London. There was no answer; Joseph was in America at that time. I hadn't much reason to like Mrs. Peckover and her daughter, but I kept up acquaintance with them because I thought they might hear of Jo some day. And after a while I sent Jane to learn a business. Do you know why I did that? Can you think why I brought up the child as if I'd only had just enough to keep us both, and never gave a sign that I could have made a rich lady of her?'

In asking the question, he bent forward and laid his hand on Sidney's shoulder. His eyes gleamed with that light which betrays the enthusiast, the idealist. As he approached the explanation to which his story had tended, the signs of age and weakness disappeared before the intensity of his feeling. Sidney understood now why he had always been conscious of something in the man's mind that was not revealed to him, of a life-controlling purpose but vaguely indicated by the general tenor of Michael's opinions. The latter's fervour affected him, and he replied with emotion:

‘You wish Jane to think of this money as you do yourself—not to regard it as wealth, but as the means of bringing help to the miserable.'

‘That is my thought, Sidney. It came to me in that form whilst I was sitting by her bed, when she was ill at Mrs. Peckover's. I knew nothing of her character then, and the idea I had might have come to nothing through her turning out untrustworthy. But I thought to myself: Suppose she grows up to be a good woman—suppose I can teach her to look at things in the same way as I do myself, train her to feel that no happiness could be greater than the power to put an end to ever so little of the want and wretchedness about her—suppose when I die I could have the certainty that all this money was going to be used for the good of the poor by a woman who herself belonged to the poor? You understand me? It would have been easy enough to leave it among charities in the ordinary way; but my idea went beyond that. I might have had Jane schooled and fashioned into a lady, and still have hoped that she would use the money well; but my idea went beyond that. There's plenty of ladies nowadays taking an interest in the miserable, and spending their means unselfishly. What I hoped was to raise up for the poor and the untaught a friend out of their own midst, some one who had gone through all that they suffer, who was accustomed to earn her own living by the work of her hands as they do, who had never thought herself their better, who saw the world as they see it and knew all their wants. A lady may do good, we know that; but she can't be the friend of the poor as I understand it; there's too great a distance between her world and theirs. Can you picture to yourself how anxiously I've watched this child from the first day she came to live with me? I've scarcely had a thought but about her. I saw very soon that she had good feelings, and I set myself to encourage them. I wanted her to be able to read and write, but there was no need of any more education than that; it was the heart I cared about, not the mind. Besides, I had always to keep saying to myself that perhaps, after all, she wouldn't turn out the kind of woman I wished, and in that case she mustn't be spoiled for an ordinary life. Sidney, it's this money that has made me a weak old man when I might still have been as strong as many at fifty; the care of it has worn me out; I haven't slept quietly since it came into my hands. But the worst is over. I shan't be disappointed. Jane will be the woman I've hoped for, and however soon my own life comes to an end, I shall die knowing that there's a true man by her side to help her to make my idea a reality.

‘I've mentioned Mr. Percival, the lawyer. He's an old man like myself, and we've had many a long talk together. About a year and a half ago I told him what I've told you now. Since I came back to England he's been managing the money for me; he's paid me the little we needed, and the rest of the income has been used in charity by some people we could trust. Well, Mr. Percival doesn't go with me in my plans for Jane. He thinks I'm making a mistake, that I ought to have had the child educated to fit her to live with rich people. It's no use; I can't get him to feel what a grand thing it'll be for Jane to go about among her own people and help them as nobody ever could. He said to me not long ago, “And isn't the girl ever to have a husband?” It's my hope that she will, I told him. “And do you suppose,” he went on, “that whoever marries her will let her live in the way you talk of? Where are you going to find a working man that'll be content never to touch this money—to work on for his weekly wages, when he might be living at his ease?” And I told him that it wasn't as impossible as he thought. What do you think, Sidney?'

The communication of a noble idea has the same effect upon the brains of certain men—of one, let us say, in every hundred thousand—as a wine that exalts and enraptures. As Sidney listened to the old man telling of his wondrous vision, he became possessed with ardour such as he had known but once or twice in his life. Idealism such as Michael Snowdon had developed in these latter years is a form of genius; given the susceptible hearer, it dazzles, inspires, raises to heroic contempt of the facts of life. Had this story been related to him of some unknown person, Sidney would have admired, but as one admires the nobly impracticable; subject to the electric influence of a man who was great enough to conceive and direct his life by such a project, who could repose so supreme a faith in those he loved, all the primitive nobleness of his character asserted itself, and he could accept with a throbbing heart the superb challenge addressed to him.

‘If Jane can think me worthy to be her husband,' he replied, ‘your friend shall see that he has feared without cause.'
‘I knew it, Sidney; I knew it!' exclaimed the old man. ‘How much younger I feel now that I have shared this burden with you!'

‘And shall you now tell Jane?' the other inquired.

‘Not yet; not just yet. She is very young; we must wait a little. But there can be no reason why you shouldn't speak to her—of yourself.'

Sidney was descending from the clouds. As the flush of his humanitarian enthusiasm passed away, and he thought of his personal relations to Jane, a misgiving, a scruple began to make itself heard within him. Worldly and commonplace the thought, but—had he a right to ask the girl to pledge herself to him under circumstances such as these? To be sure, it was not as if Jane were an heiress in the ordinary way; for all that, would it not be a proceeding of doubtful justice to woo her when as yet she was wholly ignorant of the most important item in her situation? His sincerity was unassailable, but—suppose, in fact, he had to judge the conduct of another man thus placed? Upon the heated pulsing of his blood succeeded a coolness, almost a chill; he felt as though he had been on the verge of a precipice, and had been warned to draw back only just in time. Every second showed him more distinctly what his duty was. He experienced a sensation of thankfulness that he had not spoken definitely on Saturday evening. His instinct had guided him aright; Jane was still too young to be called upon solemnly to decide her whole future.

‘That, too, had better wait, Mr. Snowdon,' he said, after a pause of a minute. ‘I should like her to know everything before I speak to her in that way. In a year it will be time enough.'

Michael regarded him thoughtfully.

‘Perhaps you are right. I wish you knew Mr. Percival; but there is time, there is time. He still thinks I shall be persuaded to alter my plans. That night you came to Hanover Street and found me away, he took me to see a lady who works among the poor in Clerkenwell; she knew me by name, because Mr. Percival had given her money from me to use, but we'd never seen each other till then. He wants me to ask her opinion about Jane.'

‘Has he spoken of her to the lady, do you think?'

‘Oh no!' replied the other, with perfect confidence. ‘He has promised me to keep all that a secret as long as I wish. The lady—her name is Miss Lant—seemed all that my friend said she was, and perhaps Jane might do well to make her acquaintance some day; but that mustn't be till Jane knows and approves the purpose of my life and hers. The one thing that troubles me still, Sidney, is—her father. It's hard that I can't be sure whether my son will be a help or a hindrance. I must wait, and try to know him better.'

The conversation had so wearied Michael, that in returning to the house he had to lean on his companion's arm. Sidney was silent, and yielded, he scarce knew why, to a mood of depression. When Jane returned from Maldon in the evening, and he heard her happy voice as the children ran out to welcome her, there was a heaviness at his heart. Perhaps it came only of hope deferred.Embed陪你 (Be With You) Lyrics陪你 由 池昌旭 (Ji Chang Wook) 歌詞

Quietly hold that snowflake in your hand

[Verse 2]
Dream, is like a myth
It’ll open into hopes
Whenever you need a warm shoulder
I am here to be your hope

[Chorus]
‘Cause of love, we are on the way from strangers to acquaintances
The beautiful memories will be the blueprint of the future
Quietly hold that snowflake in your hand

[Post-Chorus #2]
I am still with you when it melts in the next second
I am still with you when it melts in the next second (Ahh~)

[Bridge]
Falling apart into snow
It melts instantly
Everything is scattered into the starry light

[Chorus]
‘Cause of love, we are on the way from strangers to acquaintances
The beautiful memories will be the blueprint of the future
Quietly hold that snowflake in your hand

[Outro]
I am still with you when it melts in the next second
I am still with you when it melts in the next second
With youEmbedLyrical Murderers Lyrics[Sample: Royce Da 5'9" & Joe Budden]
This is the life, we gone!
I ain't with the leaning and rocking
That ain't even seen as a option...

[Intro: Crooked I (K-Young)]
You're nothing without (Focus...)
Woo.. Long Beach (Lay your seats back)
New Jersey (Turn your speakers up)
Brook-lyn! Detroit!
[Chorus: K-Young]
We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers
Welcome to the Slaughterhouse
(What you talkin 'bout?)
Where we bring them verbal llamas out, blaow
We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers
Man, we own these streets
And the freaks they love us
We ain't worried 'bout you fuckers (Slaughterhouse)

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Lyrical murderer, blame Rakim
I'm a sniper shooting my way into your lame top 10
Pistol at your head if I ain't next to Eminem
Then I bust in your face like I'm fucking Lil' Kim
Niggas better pray to the lyrical lord
That I fall off like the umbilical cord before I fill up the morgue
This is how a killer record
With the double-edged triple syllable sword
I'm iller than ordinary, see I'm a literary genius
Bury niggas with words, a cemetery linguist
Most rappers are comedy gold
They like they boyfriend's sodomy hole - they full of shit!

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Now you could walk through the shadow of death next to that shady street
Where the verbal cocaine business and 80's meet
Where them niggas is backwards
I'm riding with my daughter in the front with the A.K. in the baby seat
We them copycat killers, unleashing venom
Commit them lyrical murders and then we re-commit 'em
Lyrics be high quality
Bitches be giving me brain, my dick be deep in they heads like psychology
Independently penning the best words that were ever said
The mixture of Leatherhead and Everclear
You can't hide, we everywhere
Now, picture a grizzly standing next to a teddy bear

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Yeah, hello hip-hop, I am here, you dying yeah and I'm aware
A beast so at your wake I'll cry lion's tears
And that's no disrespect to the pioneers
If we ain't who you trying to hear
Something either wrong with your eyes and ears
I came in this game screaming Jers'
Ain't an MC in our lane to try and merge
Try and run with our wave
But I'm cool with being Eddie Levert seeing my son on stage
Gun gon' blaze, act up in this joint
And I'ma be Nate Robinson and back up the point
Your run's over, run with us or get run over
I'm here to save this shit, and I brung soldiers

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
This is lyrical murder
Me and every track have a physical merger
When I stab it in the chest I'ma bit of a curver
So it bleeds to death, like the middle of a unfinished burger
Or sometimes I wrap my hand around his throat
'Cause he think his kick is slick or his little snare is dope
Shoot the bass in the face but sometimes I carry a rope
To hang the piano keys when they hitting every note
I'm what no beat's able to withstand
If you suffer from writer's block and your label got big plans
Listen to this fam
Slide a little dough out that budget, and hire the instrumental hitman
[Chorus: K-Young]

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.

THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.


THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!

THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.

(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

CISSY CAFFREY



I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)

THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.

CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.

(She sings.)
I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.

PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!

CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)

She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.


(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.
STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.

(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)

LYNCH So that?

STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!

STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

LYNCH Ba!

STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.

LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)

BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)

BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)

THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?

THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.

BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)

BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)

BLOOM O!

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.

(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.

BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.

RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?

BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.

RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.

RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!

BLOOM Mamma!

ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!

BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

BLOOM Molly!

MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)

MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...

MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.

BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

THE SOAP

We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.


(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

SWENY Three and a penny, please.

BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

MARION (Softly.) Poldy!

BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)

BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)

BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.

BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.

(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

MRS BREEN Mr.

BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!

BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.


(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.

BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.

MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.

MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.

BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.

(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

RICHIE Best value in Dub.

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.

RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!

BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.

MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.

BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?

MRS BREEN Let's.

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

THE BAWD Jewman's melt!

BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.

BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.

BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .

MRS BREEN Too.

BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .

MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!

PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.

THE NAVVY (Shouts.)

We are the boys. Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.

THENAVVY (Shouts.)

The galling chain.
And free our native land.


(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.

(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)

Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.

BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.

(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)

THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.

(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)

FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.

BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)

THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.

BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)

SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.

BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.

FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.

FIRST WATCH Proof.

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)

BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.

FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.

SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.

BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.

MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.

FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.

BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.

SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

FIRST WATCH Regiment.

BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?

BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.

FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.

BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.

BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.


BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.

BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.

BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.

FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.

BLOOM She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!

(General laughter.)

GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.

BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)

Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...


(He is howled down.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

BLOOM A penny in the pound.

(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.

(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.

MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.

BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.

MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!

BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.

BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?

BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.

(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.

(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)

THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)

Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo


(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.

(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)

THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.

THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?

THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.

THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.

FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.

SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.

THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)

THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)

LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?

(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.

(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .

HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.

SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?

PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!

BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.

SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?

FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.

PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.

A VOICE O rocks.

PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.

(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.

PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.

(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!

JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.

(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)

BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?

BLOOM Not I!

ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)

ZOE How's the nuts?

BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.

ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.

BLOOM Not likely.

ZOE I feel it.

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)

BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)

ZOE You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.

BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.

ZOE And you know what thought did?

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?

ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!

BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

BLOOM'S BOYS

The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.


A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.

A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!

(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)

A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?

A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!

A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!

A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.

(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)

THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

ALL God save Leopold the First!

BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.

WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.

MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!

(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.

(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)

JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!

BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!

JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.

A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!

AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.

AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.

BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)

(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)

THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)

THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.


(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)


BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.


BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!


THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!


(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)


BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.


(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)


JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.


PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?


BLOOM Pay them, my friend.


PADDY LEONARD Thank you.


NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?


BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.


J.J. O'MOLLY A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O'Brien!


NOSEY FLYNN Where do I draw the five pounds?

CHRIS CALLINAN What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of Aldebaran?

BLOOM Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.

JOE HYNES Why aren't you in uniform?

BLOOM When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?

BEN DOLLARD Pansies?

BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.

BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?

BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.

LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.

CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.

BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.

ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?

BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.

O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.

DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!

BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?

(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)

FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.

MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!

MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!

NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.

BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)

I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.


HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.

PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!

BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)

LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!

THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.

BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.

THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.

THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)

(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.

MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?

BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.

BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.

BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

A DEADHAND (Writes on the wall.) Bloom is a cod. A CRAB (In bush ranger's kit.) What did you do in the cattlecreep behind Kilbarrack?

A FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?

A HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?

BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!

(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)

THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!


THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

If you see kay
Tell him he may
See you in tea
Tell him from me.


HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)

MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!

(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)

MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.

BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!

(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)

REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.

THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!

BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)

THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!

BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.

(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)

ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.

BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.

ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.

BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.

ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?

ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?

BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.

ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.

BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.

ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.

BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE Babby!

BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.

ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)

THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)

ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.

BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.

ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!

ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?

LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!

ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?

THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!

STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

THE CAP Bah!

STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)

STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!

LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)

FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY No!

ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!

FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)

STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

ALL What?

THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)

FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)

THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)

ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...

THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!

ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.

ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.

STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.

(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)

THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.

ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

LYNCH I'm not looking.

ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)

VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

BLOOM She is rather lean.

VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.

VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.

VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

BLOOM With?...

VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.

BLOOM The stye I dislike.

VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.

(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.

BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?

VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...

VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.

VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.

I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!


(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.

FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.

STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?

FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)

PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?

(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?

FLORRY And the song?

STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.

STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.

ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.

VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!

LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM Poor man!

ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.

BLOOM How?

VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.

KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?

PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.

(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)

LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.

ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.

LYNCH Three wise virgins.

VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.

(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!

A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.

HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.

VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

HENRY All is lost now.

(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.

LYNCH All one and the same God to her.

STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.

STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.

(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

THE CARDINAL

Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.


(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

(The trick doorhandle turns.)

THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

ZOE The devil is in that door.

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)

ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?

ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)

BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.

ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)

THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.

BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.

BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.

THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?

BLOOM Yes. No.

THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.

THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.

BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.

THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.

BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?

THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!

BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!

BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!

BELLO Dungdevourer!

BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.

BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!

BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.

BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.

BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.

FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.

KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.

BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

BELLO (Twisting.) Another!

BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!

BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)

BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)

BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.

ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.

BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.

BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?

BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !

BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.

BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)

BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

A BIDDER A florin!

(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

A VOICE One and eightpence too much.

THE LACQUEY Barang!

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?

BLOOM Eccles Street.

BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!

BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.

BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.

BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...

BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)

SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!

BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.

BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!

BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.

BLOOM They... I

BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...

A VOICE Swear!

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?

(He bites his thumb.)

BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!

BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)

BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)

THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.

VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)

THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.

THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.

THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?

THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.

BLOOM You understood them?

THE YEWS Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!

BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.

(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)

THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!

(They cheer.)

BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO Fool!

THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?

THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.


THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!

BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!

BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)

THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...

BLOOM Done. Prff.

THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?

BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.

BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!

THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.

THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!

BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.

THE WATERFALL

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!

THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)

THE BUTTON Bip!

(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

THE SLUTS

O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.


BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!

THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!

BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !

BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)

BELLA You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.

BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!

BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?

ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)

BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

ZOE

Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.


BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.

STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.

BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.

STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.

BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)

BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!

KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)

FLORRY And me?

LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.

BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.

BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.

ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)

BLOOM This is yours.

STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.

BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.

STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?

STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.

BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM No, but...

STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?

ZOE Is he hungry?

STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)

Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.


ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.

LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)

LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.

(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)

FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.

(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.

ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.

STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE What day were you born?

STEPHEN Thursday. Today.

ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.

FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.

ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?

BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.

BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.

ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.

BLOOM Wrong.

ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?

(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.

(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.

ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?

(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

FLORRY What?

(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)

THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?

(Bronze by gold they whisper.)

ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.

(They whisper again.)

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)

LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.

LENEHAN A good night's work.

BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.

LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!

ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.

BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?

BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?

BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.

MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!

BELLA What? What is it?

(Zoe whispers to her.)

MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.

BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.

BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...

KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!

LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.

BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!

BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!

LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!

BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?

ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.

BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM

(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!

STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.

BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.

LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.

ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous.

Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!

LYNCH Vive le vampire!

THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!

STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.

BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...

STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)

BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...

THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!

STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.

ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.

LYNCH Across the world for a wife.

FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.

STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?

BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.

STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!

BLOOM I say, look...

STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!

(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

THE CROWD

Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!


(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!

GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!

(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)

STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!

ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY

Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...


ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?

BLOOM Who'll.

LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.

STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?

(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

HOURS You may touch my.

CAVALIERS May I touch your?

HOURS O, but lightly!

CAVALIERS O, so lightly!

THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!

(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!

ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!

MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!

(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

ZOE I'm giddy.

(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)

MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)

MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!

THE PIANOLA

Best, best of all,
Baraabum!


KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!

(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)

STEPHEN Pas seul!

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

THE PIANOLA

Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.


(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)

TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!

SIMON Think of your mother's people!

STEPHEN Dance of death.

(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)

(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)

STEPHEN Ho!

(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

THE CHOIR

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...


(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.


THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.


STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?


BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.


THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.


STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.


THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.


STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.


THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.


STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!


THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!


FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.


BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.


THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!


STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!


THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)


STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)


BLOOM (At the window.) What?


STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!


FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)


THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!


STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!


THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.


STEPHEN Nothung!


(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


THE GASJET Pwfungg!


BLOOM Stop!


LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!


BELLA Police!


(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!


(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)


THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.


ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.


BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.


BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?


A WHORE He tore his coat.


BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.


BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...


BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.


BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...


BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!


BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!


FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?


BELLA Do you want me to call the police?


BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.


BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!


BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.


BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?


ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.


BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!


(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?


STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.


CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.


STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.


VOICES She's faithfultheman.


CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.


PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.


PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.


STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.


CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.


STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...


PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?


STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?


DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.


(He staggers a pace back.)


BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.


STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.


BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.


CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.


BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?


(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.


(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.


STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.


STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.

BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.

STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)

KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

PATRICE Socialiste!

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.

STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!

A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.


THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.


RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.

(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!


PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...

(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?

STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.

CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!

A ROUGH Our men retreated.

PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!

(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)

PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.

STEPHEN Did I? When?

BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.

THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!

(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.

PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)

CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!

CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.

BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!

STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.

PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!

STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.


VOICES Police!

DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.

THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Dooooooooooog!

THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Goooooooooood!

(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)

PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!

BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?

LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)

STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.

BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.

STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.

CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.

BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.

PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.

(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!

THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!

(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)

THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.

BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!

PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!

(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)

FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?

A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.

BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.

BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?

BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

FIRST WATCH Name and address.

(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.

(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.

SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.

BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.

SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)

BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...

(The horse neighs.)

THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)

CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!

THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.

BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)

CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.

BLOOM Night.

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!

STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!

(Murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)

BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!

RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed2019 K-Pop Songs (Alphabetically) LyricsA

Dust

[Verse 1: Taeyang, Daesung]
내 친구가 네 얘기를 해
좋아 보였단 말에 괜히 화를 내
어쩌면 아직도 나 땜에 네가
힘들어하길 바랬는지 몰라
요즘 가끔 나도 모르게
우리 같이 즐겨 듣던 노래를 해 (노래를 해)
옛 추억에 잠긴 오늘 같은 날
이유 없이 보고 싶어지는 밤

[Pre-Chorus: Seungri]
그땐 내가 너무 어려서
사랑이 어려워서
널 피하려고만 했지
난 부담이 됐고-우워
불만이 됐죠-우워
끝내 너를 울리고

[Chorus: Taeyang, Daesung, Seungri & T.O.P]
오늘이 지나면 넌 사라질 먼지, 사랑이 뭔지
나 슬퍼 보인다면 내 눈물은 연기, 춤추는 연기
처럼 내일이면 또 아무렇지 않게
하루가 시작돼 널 잊고 살겠죠
그저 네가 행복해지길 나는
이곳에서 남아서 웃으며 빌어 줄게 (Uh)
You might also like[Verse 2: T.O.P, G-Dragon]
혹시 기억하니, 우리들 처음 만난 날
순수한 미소 가득히 Sauvignon blanc
널 향한 이유 없는 순종 때론
거침없던 충돌 이별이
운명이란 현실 앞의 내 마지막 분노
마침 들려오는 radio에서
공감되는 사연 지금 내 맘과 똑같다며 (Woo; Ayy)
혹시 네가 아닐까
생각하다 잠이 와
시간은 참 빨리 가 넌 잘 있을까 (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus: Seungri, Daesung]
그땐 내가 너무 어려서
사랑이 어려워서
도망치려고만 했지
결국 부담이 됐고-우워
불만이 됐죠-우워
이젠 늦어 버렸지만

[Chorus: Taeyang, Daesung, Seungri]
오늘이 지나면 넌 사라질 먼지, 사랑이 뭔지
나 슬퍼 보인다면 내 눈물은 연기, 춤추는 연기
처럼 내일이면 또 아무렇지 않게
하루가 시작돼 널 잊고 살겠죠
그저 네가 행복해지길 나는
이곳에서 남아서 웃으며 빌어 줄게
[Bridge: Daesung, Taeyang & sample]
언젠가 길을 지나다
우리 다시 만날 그런 날이 온다면
그 언젠가는 서로 다른 사람과
행복한 모습으로 웃을 수 있게, so long
Love, love
Love, change
Love, hate
Love dust

[Chorus: Taeyang, Daesung, Seungri]
오늘이 지나면 넌 사라질 먼지, 사랑이 뭔지
나 슬퍼 보인다면 내 눈물은 연기, 춤추는 연기

John's father had held the amateur golf championship through many a heated contest; Mrs. Unger was known "from hot-box to hot-bed," as the local phrase went, for her political addresses; and young John T. Unger, who had just turned sixteen, had danced all the latest dances from New York before he put on long trousers. And now, for a certain time, he was to be away from home. That respect for a New England education which is the bane of all provincial places, which drains them yearly of their most promising young men, had seized upon his parents. Nothing would suit them but that he should go to St. Midas' School near Boston-- Hades was too small to hold their darling and gifted son.

Now in Hades--as you know if you ever have been there--the names of the more fashionable preparatory schools and colleges mean very little. The inhabitants have been so long out of the world that, though they make a show of keeping up to date in dress and manners and literature, they depend to a great extent on hearsay, and a function that in Hades would be considered elaborate would doubtless be hailed by a Chicago beef-princess as "perhaps a little tacky."

John T. Unger was on the eve of departure. Mrs. Unger, with maternal fatuity, packed his trunks full of linen suits and electric fans, and Mr. Unger presented his son with an asbestos pocket-book stuffed with money.

"Remember, you are always welcome here," he said. "You can be sure boy, that we'll keep the home fires burning."

"I know," answered John huskily.
"Don't forget who you are and where you come from," continued his father proudly, "and you can do nothing to harm you. You are an Unger--from Hades."

So the old man and the young shook hands and John walked away with tears streaming from his eyes. Ten minutes later he had passed outside the city limits, and he stopped to glance back for the last time. Over the gates the old-fashioned Victorian motto seemed strangely attractive to him. His father had tried time and time again to have it changed to something with a little more push and verve about it, such as "Hades--Your Opportunity," or else a plain "Welcome" sign set over a hearty handshake pricked out in electric lights. The old motto was a little depressing, Mr. Unger had thought--but now....

So John took his look and then set his face resolutely toward his destination. And, as he turned away, the lights of Hades against the sky seemed full of a warm and passionate beauty.

St. Midas' School is half an hour from Boston in a Rolls-Pierce motorcar. The actual distance will never be known, for no one, except John T. Unger, had ever arrived there save in a Rolls-Pierce and probably no one ever will again. St. Midas' is the most expensive and the most exclusive boys' preparatory school in the world.

John's first two years there passed pleasantly. The fathers of all the boys were money-kings and John spent his summers visiting at fashionable resorts. While he was very fond of all the boys he visited, their fathers struck him as being much of a piece, and in his boyish way he often wondered at their exceeding sameness. When he told them where his home was they would ask jovially, "Pretty hot down there?" and John would muster a faint smile and answer, "It certainly is." His response would have been heartier had they not all made this joke--at best varying it with, "Is it hot enough for you down there?" which he hated just as much.

In the middle of his second year at school, a quiet, handsome boy named Percy Washington had been put in John's form. The newcomer was pleasant in his manner and exceedingly well dressed even for St. Midas', but for some reason he kept aloof from the other boys. The only person with whom he was intimate was John T. Unger, but even to John he was entirely uncommunicative concerning his home or his family. That he was wealthy went without saying, but beyond a few such deductions John knew little of his friend, so it promised rich confectionery for his curiosity when Percy invited him to spend the summer at his home "in the West." He accepted, without hesitation.

It was only when they were in the train that Percy became, for the first time, rather communicative. One day while they were eating lunch in the dining-car and discussing the imperfect characters of several of the boys at school, Percy suddenly changed his tone and made an abrupt remark.

"My father," he said, "is by far the richest man in the world."

"Oh," said John, politely. He could think of no answer to make to this confidence. He considered "That's very nice," but it sounded hollow and was on the point of saying, "Really?" but refrained since it would seem to question Percy's statement. And such an astounding statement could scarcely be questioned.

"By far the richest," repeated Percy.

"I was reading in the World Almanac," began John, "that there was one man in America with an income of over five million a year and four men with incomes of over three million a year, and--"

"Oh, they're nothing." Percy's mouth was a half-moon of scorn. "Catchpenny capitalists, financial small-fry, petty merchants and money-lenders. My father could buy them out and not know he'd done it."

"But how does he--"
"Why haven't they put down his income tax? Because he doesn't pay any. At least he pays a little one--but he doesn't pay any on his real income."

"He must be very rich," said John simply. "I'm glad. I like very rich people.

"The richer a fella is, the better I like him." There was a look of passionate frankness upon his dark face. "I visited the Schnlitzer-Murphys last Easter. Vivian Schnlitzer-Murphy had rubies as big as hen's eggs, and sapphires that were like globes with lights inside them--"

"I love jewels," agreed Percy enthusiastically. "Of course I wouldn't want any one at school to know about it, but I've got quite a collection myself I used to collect them instead of stamps."

"And diamonds," continued John eagerly. "The Schnlitzer-Murphys had diamonds as big as walnuts--"

"That's nothing." Percy had leaned forward and dropped his voice to a low whisper. "That's nothing at all. My father has a diamond bigger than the Ritz-Carlton Hotel."

II

THE MONTANA sunset lay between two mountains like a gigantic bruise from which dark arteries spread themselves over a poisoned sky. An immense distance under the sky crouched the village of Fish, minute, dismal, and forgotten. There were twelve men, so it was said, in the village of Fish, twelve somber and inexplicable souls who sucked a lean milk from the almost literally bare rock upon which a mysterious populatory force had begotten them. They had become a race apart, these twelve men of Fish, like some species developed by an early whim of nature, which on second thought had abandoned them to struggle and extermination.
Out of the blue-black bruise in the distance crept a long line of moving lights upon the desolation of the land, and the twelve men of Fish gathered like ghosts at the shanty depot to watch the passing of the seven o'clock train, the Transcontinental Express from Chicago. Six times or so a year the Transcontinental Express, through some inconceivable jurisdiction, stopped at the village of Fish, and when this occurred a figure or so would disembark, mount into a buggy that always appeared from out of the dusk, and drive off toward the bruised sunset. The observation of this pointless and preposterous phenomenon had become a sort of cult among the men of Fish. To observe, that was all; there remained in them none of the vital quality of illusion which would make them wonder or speculate, else a religion might have grown up around these mysterious visitations. But the men of Fish were beyond all religion--the barest and most savage tenets of even Christianity could gain no foothold on that barren rock--so there was no altar, no priest, no sacrifice; only each night at seven the silent concourse by the shanty depot, a congregation who lifted up a prayer of dim, anaemic wonder.

On this June night, the Great Brakeman, whom, had they deified any one, they might well have chosen as their celestial protagonist, had ordained that the seven o'clock train should leave its human (or inhuman) deposit at Fish. At two minutes after seven Percy Washington and John T. Unger disembarked, hurried past the spellbound, the agape, the fearsome eyes of the twelve men of Fish, mounted into a buggy which had obviously appeared from nowhere, and drove away.

After half an hour, when the twilight had coagulated into dark, the silent negro who was driving the buggy hailed an opaque body somewhere ahead of them in the gloom. In response to his cry, it turned upon them a luminous disk which regarded them like a malignant eye out of the unfathomable night. As they came closer, John saw that it was the tail-light of an immense automobile, larger and more magnificent than any he had ever seen. Its body was of gleaming metal richer than nickel and lighter than silver, and the hubs of the wheels were studded with iridescent geometric figures of green and yellow--John did not dare to guess whether they were glass or jewel.

Two negroes, dressed in glittering livery such as one sees in pictures of royal processions in London, were standing at attention beside the car and as the two young men dismounted from the buggy they were greeted in some language which the guest could not understand, but which seemed to be an extreme form of the Southern negro's dialect.

"Get in," said Percy to his friend, as their trunks were tossed to the ebony roof of the limousine. "Sorry we had to bring you this far in that buggy, but of course it wouldn't do for the people on the train or those Godforsaken fellas in Fish to see this automobile."

"Gosh! What a car!" This ejaculation was provoked by its interior. John saw that the upholstery consisted of a thousand minute and exquisite tapestries of silk, woven with jewels and embroideries, and set upon a background of cloth of gold. The two armchair seats in which the boys luxuriated were covered with stuff that resembled duvetyn, but seemed woven in numberless colors of the ends of ostrich feathers.
"What a car!" cried John again, in amazement.

"This thing?" Percy laughed. "Why, it's just an old junk we use for a station wagon."

By this time they were gliding along through the darkness toward the break between the two mountains.

"We'll be there in an hour and a half," said Percy, looking at the clock. "I may as well tell you it's not going to be like anything you ever saw before."

If the car was any indication of what John would see, he was prepared to be astonished indeed. The simple piety prevalent in Hades has the earnest worship of and respect for riches as the first article of its creed--had John felt otherwise than radiantly humble before them, his parents would have turned away in horror at the blasphemy.

They had now reached and were entering the break between the two mountains and almost immediately the way became much rougher.

"If the moon shone down here, you'd see that we're in a big gulch," said Percy, trying to peer out of the window. He spoke a few words into the mouthpiece and immediately the footman turned on a search-light and swept the hillsides with an immense beam.

"Rocky, you see. An ordinary car would be knocked to pieces in half an hour. In fact, it'd take a tank to navigate it unless you knew the way. You notice we're going uphill now."

They were obviously ascending, and within a few minutes the car was crossing a high rise, where they caught a glimpse of a pale moon newly risen in the distance. The car stopped suddenly and several figures took shape out of the dark beside it--these were negroes also. Again the two young men were saluted in the same dimly recognizable dialect; then the negroes set to work and four immense cables dangling from overhead were attached with hooks to the hubs of the great jeweled wheels. At a resounding "Hey-yah!" John felt the car being lifted slowly from the ground-- up and up--clear of the tallest rocks on both sides--then higher, until he could see a wavy, moonlit valley stretched out before him in sharp contrast to the quagmire of rocks that they had just left. Only on one side was there still rock--and then suddenly there was no rock beside them or anywhere around.

It was apparent that they had surmounted some immense knife-blade of stone, projecting perpendicularly into the air. In a moment they were going down again, and finally with a soft bump they were landed upon the smooth earth.

"The worst is over," said Percy, squinting out the window. "It's only five miles from here, and our own road--tapestry brick--all the way. This belongs to us. This is where the United States ends, father says."

"Are we in Canada?"

"We are not. We're in the middle of the Montana Rockies. But you are now on the only five square miles of land in the country that's never been surveyed."

"Why hasn't it? Did they forget it?"

"No," said Percy, grinning, "they tried to do it three times. The first time my grandfather corrupted a whole department of the State survey; the second time he had the official maps of the United States tinkered with--that held them for fifteen years. The last time was harder. My father fixed it so that their compasses were in the strongest magnetic field ever artificially set up. He had a whole set of surveying instruments made with a slight defection that would allow for this territory not to appear, and he substituted them for the ones that were to be used. Then he had a river deflected and he had what looked like a village built up on its banks--so that they'd see it, and think it was a town ten miles farther up the valley. There's only one thing my father's afraid of," he concluded, "only one thing in the world that could be used to find us out."

"What's that?"

Percy sank his voice to a whisper.

"Aeroplanes," he breathed. "We've got half a dozen anti-aircraft guns and we've arranged it so far--but there've been a few deaths and a great many prisoners. Not that we mind that, you know, father and I, but it upsets mother and the girls, and there's always the chance that some time we won't be able to arrange it."

Shreds and tatters of chinchilla, courtesy clouds in the green moon's heaven, were passing the green moon like precious Eastern stuffs paraded for the inspection of some Tartar Khan. It seemed to John that it was day, and that he was looking at some lads sailing above him in the air, showering down tracts and patent medicine circulars, with their messages of hope for despairing, rockbound hamlets. It seemed to him that he could see them look down out of the clouds and stare--and stare at whatever there was to stare at in this place whither he was bound--What then? Were they induced to land by some insidious device there to be immured far from patent medicines and from tracts until the judgment day--or, should they fail to fall into the trap, did a quick puff of smoke and the sharp round of a splitting shell bring them drooping to earth--and "upset" Percy's mother and sisters. John shook his head and the wraith of a hollow laugh issued silently from his parted lips. What desperate transaction lay hidden here? What moral expedient of a bizarre Croesus? What terrible and golden mystery? . . .

The chinchilla clouds had drifted past now and outside the Montana night was bright as day. The tapestry brick of the road was smooth to the tread of the great tires as they rounded a still, moonlit lake; they passed into darkness for a moment, a pine grove, pungent and cool, then they came out into a broad avenue of lawn and John's exclamation of pleasure was simultaneous with Percy's taciturn "We're home."

Full in the light of the stars, an exquisite ch_teau rose from the borders of the lake, climbed in marble radiance half the height of an adjoining mountain, then melted in grace, in perfect symmetry, in translucent feminine languor, into the massed darkness of a forest of pine. The many towers, the slender tracery of the sloping parapets, the chiselled wonder of a thousand yellow windows with their oblongs and hectagons and triangles of golden light, the shattered softness of the intersecting planes of star-shine and blue shade, all trembled on John's spirit like a chord of music. On one of the towers, the tallest, the blackest at its base, an arrangement of exterior lights at the top made a sort of floating fairyland--and as John gazed up in warm enchantment the faint acciaccare sound of violins drifted down in a rococo harmony that was like nothing he had ever heard before. Then in a moment the car stopped before wide, high marble steps around which the night air was fragrant with a host of flowers. At the top of the steps two great doors swung silently open and amber light flooded out upon the darkness, silhouetting the figure of an exquisite lady with black, high-piled hair, who held out her arms toward them.

"Mother," Percy was saying, "this is my friend, John Unger, from Hades."

Afterward John remembered that first night as a daze of many colors, of quick sensory impressions, of music soft as a voice in love, and of the beauty of things, lights and shadows, and motions and faces. There was a whitehaired man who stood drinking a many-hued cordial from a crystal thimble set on a golden stem. There was a girl with a flowery face, dressed like Titania with braided sapphires in her hair. There was a room where the solid, soft gold of the walls yielded to the pressure of his hand, and a room that was like a platonic conception of the ultimate prism--ceiling, floor, and all, it was lined with an unbroken mass of diamonds, diamonds of every size and shape, until, lit with tall violet lamps in the corners, it dazzled the eyes with a whiteness that could be compared only with itself, beyond human wish or dream.

Through a maze of these rooms the two boys wandered. Sometimes the floor under their feet would flame in brilliant patterns from lighting below, patterns of barbaric clashing colors, of pastel delicacy, of sheer whiteness, or of subtle and intricate mosaic, surely from some mosque on the Adriatic Sea. Sometimes beneath layers of thick crystal he would see blue or green water swirling, inhabited by vivid fish and growths of rainbow foliage. Then they would be treading on furs of every texture and color or along corridors of palest ivory, unbroken as though carved complete from the gigantic tusks of dinosaurs extinct before the age of man. . . .

Then a hazily remembered transition, and they were at dinner--where each plate was of two almost imperceptible layers of solid diamond between which was curiously worked a filigree of emerald design, a shaving sliced from green air. Music, plangent and unobtrusive, drifted down through far corridors--his chair, feathered and curved insidiously to his back, seemed to engulf and overpower him as he drank his first glass of port. He tried drowsily to answer a question that had been asked him, but the honeyed luxury that clasped his body added to the illusion of sleep--jewels, fabrics, wines, and metals blurred before his eyes into a sweet mist. . . .

"Yes," he replied with a polite effort, "it certainly is hot enough for me down there."

He managed to add a ghostly laugh; then, without movement, without resistance, he seemed to float off and away, leaving an iced dessert that was pink as a dream. . . . He fell asleep.

When he awoke he knew that several hours had passed. He was in a great quiet room with ebony walls and a dull illumination that was too faint, too subtle, to be called a light. His young host was standing over him.

"You fell asleep at dinner," Percy was saying. "I nearly did, too--it was such a treat to be comfortable again after this year of school. Servants undressed and bathed you while you were sleeping."

"Is this a bed or a cloud?" sighed John. "Percy, Percy--before you go, I want to apologize."

"For what?"

"For doubting you when you said you had a diamond as big as the Ritz-Carlton Hotel."

Percy smiled.

"I thought you didn't believe me. It's that mountain, you know."

"What mountain?"

"The mountain the ch_teau rests on. It's not very big, for a mountain. But except about fifty feet of sod and gravel on top it's solid diamond.One diamond, one cubic mile without a flaw. Aren't you listening? Say----"

But John T. Unger had again fallen asleep.

III

MORNING. As he awoke he perceived drowsily that the room had at the same moment become dense with sunlight. The ebony panels of one wall had slid aside on a sort of track, leaving his chamber half open to the day. A large negro in a white uniform stood beside his bed.
"Good-evening," muttered John, summoning his brains from the wild places.

"Good-morning, sir. Are you ready for your bath, sir? Oh, don't get up--I'll put you in, if you'll just unbutton your pajamas--there. Thank you, sir."

John lay quietly as his pajamas were removed--he was amused and delighted; he expected to be lifted like a child by this black Gargantua who was tending him, but nothing of the sort happened; instead he felt the bed tilt up slowly on its side--he began to roll, startled at first, in the direction of the wall, but when he reached the wall its drapery gave way, and sliding two yards farther down a fleecy incline he plumped gently into water the same temperature as his body.

He looked about him. The runway or rollway on which he had arrived had folded gently back into place. He had been projected into another chamber and was sitting in a sunken bath with his head just above the level of the floor. All about him, lining the walls of the room and the sides and bottom of the bath itself, was a blue aquarium, and gazing through the crystal surface on which he sat, he could see fish swimming among amber lights and even gliding without curiosity past his outstretched toes, which were separated from them only by the thickness of the crystal. From overhead, sunlight came down through sea-green glass.

I suppose, sir, that you'd like hot rosewater and soapsuds this morning sir--and perhaps cold salt water to finish."

The negro was standing beside him.

"Yes," agreed John, smiling inanely, "as you please." Any idea of ordering this bath according to his own meager standards of living would have been priggish and not a little wicked.

The negro pressed a button and a warm rain began to fall, apparently from overhead, but really, so John discovered after a moment, from a fountain arrangement near by. The water turned to a pale rose color and jets of liquid soap spurted into it from four miniature walrus heads at the corners of the bath. In a moment a dozen little paddle-wheels, fixed to the sides, had churned the mixture into a radiant rainbow of pink foam which enveloped him softly with its delicious lightness, and burst in shining, rosy bubbles here and there about him.

"Shall I turn on the moving-picture machine, sir?" suggested the negro deferentially. "There's a good one-reel comedy in this machine to-day, or can put in a serious piece in a moment, if you prefer it."

"No, thanks," answered John, politely but firmly. He was enjoying his at too much to desire any distraction. But distraction came. In a moment he was listening intently to the sound of flutes from just outside, flutes ripping a melody that was like a waterfall, cool and green as the room itself, accompanying a frothy piccolo, in play more fragile than the lace of u s that covered and charmed him.

After a cold salt-water bracer and a cold fresh finish, he stepped out and into a fleecy robe, and upon a couch covered with the same material he was rubbed with oil, alcohol, and spice. Later he sat in a voluptuous chair while he was shaved and his hair was trimmed.

"Mr. Percy is waiting in your sitting-room," said the negro, when these operations were finished. "My name is Gygsum, Mr. Unger, sir. I am to see to Mr. Unger every morning."

John walked out into the brisk sunshine of his living-room, where he found breakfast waiting for him and Percy, gorgeous in white kid knickerbockers, smoking in an easy chair.

IV

THIS IS A STORY of the Washington family as Percy sketched it for John during breakfast.
The father of the present Mr. Washington had been a Virginian, a direct descendant of George Washington, and Lord Baltimore. At the close of the Civil War he was a twenty-five-year-old Colonel with a played-out plantation and about a thousand dollars in gold.

Fitz-Norman Culpepper Washington, for that was the young Colonel's name, decided to present the Virginia estate to his younger brother and go West. He selected two dozen of the most faithful blacks, who, of course, worshipped him, and bought twenty-five tickets to the West, where he intended to take out land in their names and start a sheep and cattle ranch.

When he had been in Montana for less than a month and things were going very poorly indeed, he stumbled on his great discovery. He had lost his way when riding in the hills, and after a day without food he began to grow hungry. As he was without his rifle, he was forced to pursue a squirrel, and in the course of the pursuit he noticed that it was carrying something shiny in its mouth. Just before it vanished into its hole--for Providence did not intend that this squirrel should alleviate his hunger--it dropped its burden. Sitting down to consider the situation Fitz-Norman's eye was caught by a gleam in the grass beside him. In ten seconds he had completely lost his appetite and gained one hundred thousand dollars. The squirrel, which had refused with annoying persistence to become food, had made him a present of a large and perfect diamond.

Late that night he found his way to camp and twelve hours later all the males among his darkies were back by the squirrel hole digging furiously at the side of the mountain. He told them he had discovered a rhinestone mine, and, as only one or two of them had ever seen even a small diamond before, they believed him, without question. When the magnitude of his discovery became apparent to him, he found himself in a quandary. The mountain was a diamond--it was literally nothing else but solid diamond. He filled four saddle bags full of glittering samples and started on horseback for St. Paul. There he managed to dispose of half a dozen small stones--when he tried a larger one a storekeeper fainted and Fitz-Norman was arrested as a public disturber. He escaped from jail and caught the train for New York, where he sold a few medium-sized diamonds and received in exchange about two hundred thousand dollars in gold. But he did not dare to produce any exceptional gems--in fact, he left New York just in time. Tremendous excitement had been created in jewelry circles, not so much by the size of his diamonds as by their appearance in the city from mysterious sources. Wild rumors became current that a diamond mine had been discovered in the Catskills, on the Jersey coast, on Long Island, beneath Washington Square. Excursion trains, packed with men carrying picks and shovels, began to leave New York hourly, bound for various neighboring El Dorados. But by that time young Fitz-Norman was on his way back to Montana.

By the end of a fortnight he had estimated that the diamond in the mountain was approximately equal in quantity to all the rest of the diamonds known to exist in the world. There was no valuing it by any regular computation, however, for it was one solid diamond--and if it were offered for sale not only would the bottom fall out of the market, but also, if the value should vary with its size in the usual arithmetical progression, there would not be enough gold in the world to buy a tenth part of it. And what could any one do with a diamond that size?

It was an amazing predicament. He was, in one sense, the richest man that ever lived--and yet was he worth anything at all? If his secret should transpire there was no telling to what measures the Government might resort in order to prevent a panic, in gold as well as in jewels. They might take over the claim immediately and institute a monopoly.

There was no alternative--he must market his mountain in secret. He sent South for his younger brother and put him in charge of his colored following--darkies who had never realized that slavery was abolished. To make sure of this, he read them a proclamation that he had composed, which announced that General Forrest had reorganized the shattered Southern armies and defeated the North in one pitched battle. The negroes believed him implicitly. They passed a vote declaring it a good thing and held revival services immediately.

Fitz-Norman himself set out for foreign parts with one hundred thousand dollars and two trunks filled with rough diamonds of all sizes. He sailed for Russia in a Chinese junk and six months after his departure from Montana he was in St. Petersburg. He took obscure lodgings and called immediately upon the court jeweller, announcing that he had a diamond for the Czar. He remained in St. Petersburg for two weeks, in constant danger of being murdered, living from lodging to lodging, and afraid to visit his trunks more than three or four times during the whole fortnight.

On his promise to return in a year with larger and finer stones, he was allowed to leave for India. Before he left, however, the Court Treasurers had deposited to his credit, in American banks, the sum of fifteen million dollars--under four different aliases.

He returned to America in 1868, having been gone a little over two years. He had visited the capitals of twenty-two countries and talked with five emperors, eleven kings, three princes, a shah, a khan, and a sultan. At that time Fitz-Norman estimated his own wealth at one billion dollars. One fact worked consistently against the disclosure of his secret. No one of his larger diamonds remained in the public eye for a week before being invested with a history of enough fatalities, amours, revolutions, and wars to have occupied it from the days of the first Babylonian Empire.

From 1870 until his death in 1900, the history of Fitz-Norman Washington was a long epic in gold. There were side issues, of course--he evaded the surveys, he married a Virginia lady, by whom he had a single son, and he was compelled, due to a series of unfortunate complications, to murder his brother, whose unfortunate habit of drinking himself into an indiscreet stupor had several times endangered their safety. But very few other murders stained these happy years of progress and expansion.

Just before he died he changed his policy, and with all but a few million dollars of his outside wealth bought up rare minerals in bulk, which he deposited in the safety vaults of banks all over the world, marked as bric-_-brac. His son, Braddock Tarleton Washington, followed this policy on an even more tensive scale. The minerals were converted into the rarest of all elements--radium--so that the equivalent of a billion dollars in gold could be placed in a receptacle no bigger than a cigar box.

When Fitz-Norman had been dead three years his son, Braddock, decided that the business had gone far enough. The amount of wealth that he and his father had taken out of the mountain was beyond all exact computation. He kept a note-book in cipher in which he set down the approximate quantity of radium in each of the thousand banks he patronized, and recorded the alias under which it was held. Then he did a very simple thing--he sealed up the mine.

He sealed up the mine. What had been taken out of it would support all the Washingtons yet to be born in unparalleled luxury for generations. His one care must be the protection of his secret, lest in the possible panic attendant on its discovery he should be reduced with all the property-holders in the world to utter poverty.

This was the family among whom John T. Unger was staying. This was the story he heard in his silver-walled living-room the morning after his arrival.

IV

AFTER BREAKFAST, John found his way out the great marble entrance and looked curiously at the scene before him. The whole valley, from the diamond mountain to the steep granite cliff five miles away, still gave off a breath of golden haze which hovered idly above the fine sweep of lawns and lakes and gardens. Here and there clusters of elms made delicate groves of shade, contrasting strangely with the tough masses of pine forest that held the hills in a grip of dark-blue green. Even as John looked he saw three fawns in single file patter out from one clump about a half mile away and disappear with awkward gayety into the black-ribbed half-light of another. John would not have been surprised to see a goat-foot piping his way among the trees or to catch a glimpse of pink nymph-skin and flying yellow hair between the greenest of the green leaves.
In some such cool hope he descended the marble steps, disturbing faintly the sleep of two silky Russian wolfhounds at the bottom, and set off along a walk of white and blue brick that seemed to lead in no particular direction.

He was enjoying himself as much as he was able. It is youth's felicity as well as its insufficiency that it can never live in the present, but must always be measuring up the day against its own radiantly imagined future--flowers and gold, girls and stars, they are only prefigurations and prophecies of that incomparable, unattainable young dream.

John rounded a soft corner where the massed rose-bushes filled the air with heavy scent, and struck off across a park toward a patch of moss under some trees. He had never lain upon moss, and he wanted to see whether it was really soft enough to justify the use of its name as an adjective. Then he saw a girl coming toward him over the grass. She was the most beautiful person he had ever seen

She was dressed in a white little gown that came just below her knees, and a wreath of mignonettes clasped with blue slices of sapphire bound up her hair. Her pink bare feet scattered the dew before them as she came. She was younger than John--not more than sixteen.

"Hello," she cried softly, "I'm Kismine."

She was much more than that to John already. He advanced toward her, scarcely moving as he drew near lest he should tread on her bare toes.

"You haven't met me," said her soft voice. Her blue eyes added, "Oh, but you've missed a great deal!" . . . "You met my sister, Jasmine, last night. I was sick with lettuce poisoning," went on her soft voice, and her eyes continued, "and when I'm sick I'm sweet--and when I'm well."

"You have made an enormous impression on me," said John's eyes, "and I'm not so slow myself"--"How do you do?" said his voice. "I hope you're better this morning."--"You darling," added his eyes tremulously.

John observed that they had been walking along the path. On her suggestion they sat down together upon the moss, the softness of which he failed to determine.

He was critical about women. A single defect--a thick ankle, a hoarse voice, a glass eye--was enough to make him utterly indifferent. And here for the first time in his life he was beside a girl who seemed to him the incarnation of physical perfection.

"Are you from the East?" asked Kismine with charming interest.

"No," answered John simply. "I'm from Hades."

Either she had never heard of Hades, or she could think of no pleasant comment to make upon it, for she did not discuss it further.

"I'm going East to school this fall," she said. "D'you think I'll like it? I'm going to New York to Miss Bulge's. It's very strict, but you see over the weekends I'm going to live at home with the family in our New York house, because father heard that the girls had to go walking two by two."

"Your father wants you to be proud," observed John.

"We are," she answered, her eyes shining with dignity."None of us has ever been punished. Father said we never should be. Once when my sister Jasmine was a little girl she pushed him down-stairs and he just got up and limped away.

"Mother was--well, a little startled," continued Kismine, "when she heard that you were from--from where you are from, you know. She said that when she was a young girl--but then, you see, she's a Spaniard and old-fashioned."

"Do you spend much time out here?" asked John, to conceal the fact that he was somewhat hurt by this remark. It seemed an unkind allusion to his provincialism.

"Percy and Jasmine and I are here every summer, but next summer Jasmine is going to Newport. She's coming out in London a year from this fall. She'll be presented at court."

"Do you know, " began John hesitantly, "you're much more sophisticated than I thought you were when I first saw you?"

"Oh, no, I'm not," she exclaimed hurriedly. "Oh, I wouldn't think of being. I think that sophisticated young people are terriblycommon, don't you? I'm not at all, really. If you say I am, I'm going to cry."

She was so distressed that her lip was trembling. John was impelled to protest:

I didn't mean that; I only said it to tease you."

"Because I wouldn't mind if I were," she persisted. "but I'm not. I'm very innocent and girlish. I never smoke, or drink, or read anything except poetry. I know scarcely any mathematics or chemistry. I dress very simply--in fact, I scarcely dress at all. I think sophisticated is the last thing you can say about me. I believe that girls ought to enjoy their youths in a wholesome way."

"I do, too," said John heartily.

Kismine was cheerful again. She smiled at him, and a still-born tear dripped from the corner of one blue eye.

"I like you," she whispered, intimately. "Are you going to spend all your time with Percy while you're here, or will you be nice to me. Just think--I'm absolutely fresh ground. I've never had a boy in love with me in all my life. I've never been allowed even to see boys alone--except Percy. I came all the way out here into this grove hoping to run into you, where the family wouldn't be around.

Deeply flattered, John bowed from the hips as he had been taught at dancing school in Hades.

"We'd better go now," said Kismine sweetly. "I have to be with mother at eleven. You haven't asked me to kiss you once. I thought boys always did that nowadays."

John drew himself up proudly.

"Some of them do," he answered, "but not me. Girls don't do that sort of thing--in Hades."

Side by side they walked back toward the house.

VI

JOHN STOOD facing Mr. Braddock Washington in the full sunlight. The elder man was about forty with a proud, vacuous face, intelligent eyes, and a robust figure. In the mornings he smelt of horses--the best horses. He carried a plain walking-stick of gray birch with a single large opal for a grip. He and Percy were showing John around.
"The slaves' quarters are there." His walking-stick indicated a cloister of marble on their left that ran in graceful Gothic along the side of the mountain. "In my youth I was distracted for a while from the business of life by a period of absurd idealism. During that time they lived in luxury. For instance, I equipped every one of their rooms with a tile bath."

"I suppose," ventured John, with an ingratiating laugh, "that they used the bathtubs to keep coal in. Mr. Schnlitzer-Murphy told me that once he----"

"The opinions of Mr. Schnlitzer-Murphy are of little importance, I should imagine," interrupted Braddock Washington, coldly. "My slaves did not keep coal in their bathtubs. They had orders to bathe every day, and they did. If they hadn't I might have ordered a sulphuric acid shampoo. I discontinued the baths for quite another reason. Several of them caught cold and died. Water is not good for certain races--except as a beverage."

John laughed, and then decided to nod his head in sober agreement. Braddock Washington made him uncomfortable.

"All these negroes are descendants of the ones my father brought North with him. There are about two hundred and fifty now. You notice that they've lived so long apart from the world that their original dialect has become an almost indistinguishable patois. We bring a few of them up to speak English--my secretary and two or three of the house servants.

"This is the golf course," he continued, as they strolled along the velvet winter grass. "It's all a green, you see--no fairway, no rough, no hazards."

He smiled pleasantly at John.

"Many men in the cage, father?" asked Percy suddenly.

Braddock Washington stumbled, and let forth an involuntary curse.

"One less than there should be," he ejaculated darkly--and then added after a moment, "We've had difficulties."

"Mother was telling me," exclaimed Percy, "that Italian teacher----"

"A ghastly error," said Braddock Washington angrily. "But of course there's a good chance that we may have got him. Perhaps he fell somewhere in the woods or stumbled over a cliff. And then there's always the probability that if he did get away his story wouldn't be believed. Nevertheless, I've had two dozen men looking for him in different towns around here."

"And no luck?"

"Some. Fourteen of them reported to my agent that they'd each killed a man answering to that description, but of course it was probably only the reward they were after----"

He broke off. They had come to a large cavity in the earth about the circumference of a merry-go-round and covered by a strong iron grating. Braddock Washington beckoned to John, and pointed his cane down through the grating. John stepped to the edge and gazed. Immediately his ears were assailed by a wild clamor from below.

"Come on down to Hell!"

"Hello, kiddo, how's the air up there?"

"Hey! Throw us a rope!"

"Got an old doughnut, Buddy, or a couple of second-hand sandwiches?"

"Say, fella, if you'll push down that guy you're with, we'll show you a quick disappearance scene."

"Paste him one for me, will you?"

It was too dark to see clearly into the pit below, but John could tell from the coarse optimism and rugged vitality of the remarks and voices that they proceeded from middle-class Americans of the more spirited type. Then Mr. Washington put out his cane and touched a button in the grass, and the scene below sprang into light.

"These are some adventurous mariners who had the misfortune to discover El Dorado," he remarked.

Below them there had appeared a large hollow in the earth shaped like the interior of a bowl. The sides were steep and apparently of polished glass, and on its slightly concave surface stood about two dozen men clad in the half costume, half uniform, of aviators. Their upturned faces, lit with wrath with malice, with despair, with cynical humor, were covered by long growths of beard, but with the exception of a few who had pined perceptibly away, they seemed to be a well-fed, healthy lot.

Braddock Washington drew a garden chair to the edge of the pit and sat down.

"Well, how are you, boys?" he inquired genially.

A chorus of execration in which all joined except a few too dispirited to cry out, rose up into the sunny air, but Braddock Washington heard it with unruffled composure. When its last echo had died away he spoke again.

"Have you thought up a way out of your difficulty?"

From here and there among them a remark floated up.

"We decided to stay here for love!"

"Bring us up there and we'll find us a way!"

Braddock Washington waited until they were again quiet. Then he said:

"I've told you the situation. I don't want you here. I wish to heaven I'd never seen you. Your own curiosity got you here, and any time that you can think of a way out which protects me and my interests I'll be glad to consider it. But so long as you confine your efforts to digging tunnels--yes, I know about the new one you've started--you won't get very far. This isn't as hard on you as you make it out, with all your howling for the loved ones at home. If you were the type who worried much about the loved ones at home, you'd never have taken up aviation."

A tall man moved apart from the others, and held up his hand to call his captor's attention to what he was about to say.

"Let me ask you a few questions!" he cried. "You pretend to be a fair-minded man."

"How absurd. How could a man of my position be fair-minded toward you? You might as well speak of a Spaniard being fair-minded toward a piece of steak."

At this harsh observation the faces of the two dozen steaks fell, but the tall man continued:

"All right!" he cried. "We've argued this out before. You're not a humanitarian and you're not fair-minded, but you're human--at least you say you are--and you ought to be able to put yourself in our place for long enough to think how--how--how----

"How what?" demanded Washington, coldly.

"--how unnecessary----"

"Not to me."

"Well,--how cruel----"

"We've covered that. Cruelty doesn't exist where self-preservation is involved. You've been soldiers; you know that. Try another."

"Well, then, how stupid." "There," admitted Washington, "I grant you that. But try to think of an alternative. I've offered to have all or any of you painlessly executed if you wish. I've offered to have your wives, sweethearts, children, and mothers kidnapped and brought out here. I'll enlarge your place down there and feed and clothe you the rest of your lives. If there was some method of producing permanent amnesia I'd have all of you operated on and released immediately, somewhere outside of my preserves. But that's as far as my ideas go."

"How about trusting us not to peach on you?" cried some one.

"You don't proffer that suggestion seriously," said Washington, with an expression of scorn. "I did take out one man to teach my daughter Italian. Last week he got away."

A wild yell of jubilation went up suddenly from two dozen throats and a pandemonium of joy ensued. The prisoners clog-danced and cheered and yodled and wrestled with one another in a sudden uprush of animal spirits. They even ran up the glass sides of the bowl as far as they could, and slid back to the bottom upon the natural cushions of their bodies. The tall man started a song in which they all joined--

"oh, we'll hang the kaiser
on a sour apple tree----"
Braddock Washington sat in inscrutable silence until the song was over. "You see," he remarked, when he could gain a modicum of attention. "I bear you no ill-will. I like to see you enjoying yourselves. That's why I didn't tell you the whole story at once. The man--what was his name? Critchtichiello? --was shot by some of my agents in fourteen different places."
Not guessing that the places referred to were cities, the tumult of rejoicing subsided immediately.

"Nevertheless," cried Washington with a touch of anger, "he tried to run away. Do you expect me to take chances with any of you after an experience like that?"

Again a series of ejaculations went up.

"Sure!"

"Would your daughter like to learn Chinese?"

"Hey, I can speak Italian! My mother was a wop."

"Maybe she'd like t'learna speak N'Yawk!"

"If she's the little one with the big blue eyes I can teach her a lot of things better than Italian."

"I know some Irish songs--and I could hammer brass once't.

Mr. Washington reached forward suddenly with his cane and pushed the button in the grass so that the picture below went out instantly, and there remained only that great dark mouth covered dismally with the black teeth of the grating.

"Hey!" called a single voice from below, "you ain't goin' away without givin' us your blessing?"

But Mr. Washington, followed by the two boys, was already strolling on toward the ninth hole of the golf course, as though the pit and its contents were no more than a hazard over which his facile iron had triumphed with ease.

VII

JULY UNDER the lee of the diamond mountain was a month of blanket nights and of warm, glowing days. John and Kismine were in love. He did not know that the little gold football (inscribed with the legend Pro deo et patria et St. Midas) which he had given her rested on a platinum chain next to her bosom. But it did. And she for her part was not aware that a large sapphire which had dropped one day from her simple coiffure was stowed away tenderly in John's jewel box.
Late one afternoon when the ruby and ermine music room was quiet, they spent an hour there together. He held her hand and she gave him such a look that he whispered her name aloud. She bent toward him--then hesitated.

"Did you say 'Kismine'?" she asked softly, "or----"

She had wanted to be sure. She thought she might have misunderstood.

Neither of them had ever kissed before, but in the course of an hour it seemed to make little difference.

The afternoon drifted away. That night when a last breath of music drifted down from the highest tower, they each lay awake, happily dreaming over the separate minutes of the day. They had decided to be married as soon as possible.

VIII

EVERY DAY Mr. Washington and the two young men went hunting or fishing in the deep forests or played golf around the somnolent course--games which John diplomatically allowed his host to win--or swam in the mountain coolness of the lake. John found Mr. Washington a somewhat exacting personality--utterly uninterested in any ideas or opinions except his own. Mrs. Washington was aloof and reserved at all times. She was apparently indifferent to her two daughters, and entirely absorbed in her son Percy, with whom she held interminable conversations in rapid Spanish at dinner.
Jasmine, the elder daughter, resembled Kismine in appearance--except that she was somewhat bow-legged, and terminated in large hands and feet--but was utterly unlike her in temperament. Her favorite books had to do with poor girls who kept house for widowed fathers. John learned from Kismine that Jasmine had never recovered from the shock and disappointment caused her by the termination of the World War, just as she was about to start for Europe as a canteen expert. She had even pined away for a time, and Braddock Washington had taken steps to promote a new war in the Balkans--but she had seen a photograph of some wounded Serbian soldiers and lost interest in the whole proceedings. But Percy and Kismine seemed to have inherited the arrogant attitude in all its harsh magnificence from their father. A chaste and consistent selfishness ran like a pattern through their every idea.

John was enchanted by the wonders of the ch_teau and the valley. Braddock Washington, so Percy told him, had caused to be kidnapped a landscape gardener, an architect, a designer of state settings, and a French decadent poet left over from the last century. He had put his entire force of negroes at their disposal, guaranteed to supply them with any materials that the world could offer, and left them to work out some ideas of their own. But one by one they had shown their uselessness. The decadent poet had at once begun bewailing his separation from the boulevards in spring--he made some vague remarks about spices, apes, and ivories, but said nothing that was of any practical value. The stage designer on his part wanted to make the whole valley a series of tricks and sensational effects--a state of things that the Washingtons would soon have grown tired of. And as for the architect and the landscape gardener, they thought only in terms of convention. They must make this like this and that like that.

But they had, at least, solved the problem of what was to be done with them--they all went mad early one morning after spending the night in a single room trying to agree upon the location of a fountain, and were now confined comfortably in an insane asylum at Westport, Connecticut.

"But," inquired John curiously, "who did plan all your wonderful reception rooms and halls, and approaches and bathrooms----?"

"Well," answered Percy, "I blush to tell you, but it was a moving-picture fella. He was the only man we found who was used to playing with an unlimited amount of money, though he did tuck his napkin in his collar and couldn't read or write."

As August drew to a close John began to regret that he must soon go back to school. He and Kismine had decided to elope the following June.

"It would be nicer to be married here," Kismine confessed, "but of course I could never get father's permission to marry you at all. Next to that I'd rather elope. It's terrible for wealthy people to be married in America at present--they always have to send out bulletins to the press saying that they're going to be married in remnants, when what they mean is just a peck of old second-hand pearls and some used lace worn once by the Empress Eug_nie."

"I know," agreed John fervently. "When I was visiting the Schnlitzer-Murphys, the eldest daughter, Gwendolyn, married a man whose father owns half of West Virginia. She wrote home saying what a tough struggle she was carrying on on his salary as a bank clerk--and then she ended up by saying that 'Thank God, I have four good maids anyhow, and that helps a little.'"

"It's absurd," commented Kismine. "Think of the millions and millions of people in the world, laborers and all, who get along with only two maids."

One afternoon late in August a chance remark of Kismine's changed the face of the entire situation, and threw John into a state of terror.

They were in their favorite grove, and between kisses John was indulging in some romantic forebodings which he fancied added poignancy to their relations.

"Sometimes I think we'll never marry," he said sadly.

"You're too wealthy, too magnificent. No one as rich as you are can be like other girls. I should marry the daughter of some well-to-do wholesale hardware man from Omaha or Sioux City, and be content with her half-million."

"I knew the daughter of a wholesale hardware man once," remarked Kismine. "I don't think you'd have been contented with her. She was a friend of my sister's. She visited here."

"Oh, then you've had other guests?" exclaimed John in surprise.

Kismine seemed to regret her words.

"Oh, yes," she said hurriedly, "we've had a few."

"But aren't you--wasn't your father afraid they'd talk outside?"

"Oh, to some extent, to some extent," she answered. "Let's talk about something pleasanter."

But John's curiosity was aroused.

"Something pleasanter!" he demanded. "What's unpleasant about that? Weren't they nice girls?"

To his great surprise Kismine began to weep.

"Yes--th--that's the--the whole t-trouble. I grew qu-quite attached to some of them. So did Jasmine, but she kept inv-viting them anyway. I couldn't understand it."

A dark suspicion was born in John's heart.

"Do you mean that they told, and your father had them--removed?"

"Worse than that," she muttered brokenly. "Father took no chances--and Jasmine kept writing them to come, and they had such a good time!"

She was overcome by a paroxysm of grief.

Stunned with the horror of this revelation, John sat there open-mouthed, feeling the nerves of his body twitter like so many sparrows perched upon his spinal column.

"Now, I've told you, and I shouldn't have," she said, calming suddenly and drying her dark blue eyes.

"Do you mean to say that your father had them murdered before they left?"

She nodded.

"In August usually--or early in September. It's only natural for us to get all the pleasure out of them that we can first."

"How abdominable! How--why, I must be going crazy! Did you really admit that--"

"I did," interrupted Kismine, shrugging her shoulders. "We can't very well imprison them like those aviators, where they'd be a continual reproach to us every day. And it's always been made easier for Jasmine and me because father had it done sooner than we expected. In that way we avoided any farewell scene----"

"So you murdered them! Uh!" cried John.

"It was done very nicely. They were drugged while they were asleep--and their families were always told that they died of scarlet fever in Butte."

"But--I fail to understand why you kept on inviting them!"

"I didn't," burst out Kismine. "I never invited one. Jasmine did. And they always had a very good time. She'd give them the nicest presents toward the last. I shall probably have visitors too--I'll harden up to it. We can't let such an inevitable thing as death stand in the way of enjoying life while we have it. Think how lonesome it'd be out here if we never had any one. Why, father and mother have sacrificed some of their best friends just as we have."

"And so," cried John accusingly, "and so you were letting me make love to you and pretending to return it, and talking about marriage, all the time knowing perfectly well that I'd never get out of here alive--"

"No," she protested passionately. "Not any more. I did at first. You were here. I couldn't help that, and I thought your last days might as well be pleasant for both of us. But then I fell in love with you, and--and I'm honestly sorry you're going to--going to be put away--though I'd rather you'd be put away than ever kiss another girl."

"Oh, you would, would you?" cried John ferociously.

"Much rather. Besides, I've always heard that a girl can have more fun with a man whom she knows she can never marry. Oh, why did I tell you? I've probably spoiled your whole good time now, and we were really enjoying things when you didn't know it. I knew it would make things sort of depressing for you."

"Oh, you did, did you?" John's voice trembled with anger. "I've heard about enough of this. If you haven't any more pride and decency than to have an affair with a fellow that you know isn't much better than a corpse, I don't want to have any more to do with you!"

"You're not a corpse!" she protested in horror. "You're not a corpse! I won't have you saying that I kissed a corpse!"

"I said nothing of the sort!"

"You did! You said I kissed a corpse!"

"I didn't ! "

Their voices had risen, but upon a sudden interruption they both subsided into immediate silence. Footsteps were coming along the path in their direction, and a moment later the rose bushes were parted displaying Braddock Washington, whose intelligent eyes set in his good-looking vacuous face were peering in at them.

"Who kissed a corpse?" he demanded in obvious disapproval.

"Nobody," answered Kismine quickly. "We were just joking."

"What are you two doing here, anyhow?" he demanded gruffly. "Kismine, you ought to be--to be reading or playing golf with your sister. Go read! Go play golf! Don't let me find you here when I come back!"

Then he bowed at John and went up the path.

"See?" said Kismine crossly, when he was out of hearing. "You've spoiled it all. We can never meet any more. He won't let me meet you. He'd have you poisoned if he thought we were in love."

"We're not, any more!" cried John fiercely, "so he can set his mind at rest upon that. Moreover, don't fool yourself that I'm going to stay around here. Inside of six hours I'll be over those mountains, if I have to gnaw a passage through them, and on my way East."

They had both got to their feet, and at this remark Kismine came close and put her arm through his.

"I'm going, too."

"You must be crazy----"

"Of course I'm going," she interrupted impatiently.

"You most certainly are not. You----"

"Very well," she said quietly, "we'll catch up with father now and talk it over with him."

Defeated, John mustered a sickly smile.

"Very well, dearest," he agreed, with pale and unconvincing affection, "we'll go together."

His love for her returned and settled placidly on his heart. She was his--she would go with him to share his dangers. He put his arms about her and kissed her fervently. After all she loved him; she had saved him, in fact.

Discussing the matter, they walked slowly back toward the ch_teau. They decided that since Braddock Washington had seen them together they had best depart the next night. Nevertheless, John's lips were unusually dry at dinner, and he nervously emptied a great spoonful of peacock soup into his left lung. He had to be carried into the turquoise and sable card-room and pounded on the back by one of the under-butlers, which Percy considered a great joke.

IX

LONG AFTER midnight John's body gave a nervous jerk, and he sat suddenly upright, staring into the veils of somnolence that draped the room. Through the squares of blue darkness that were his open windows, he had heard a faint far-away sound that died upon a bed of wind before identifying itself on his memory, clouded with uneasy dreams. But the sharp noise that had succeeded it was nearer, was just outside the room--the click of a turned knob, a footstep, a whisper, he could not tell; a hard lump gathered in the pit of his stomach, and his whole body ached in the moment that he strained agonizingly to hear. Then one of the veils seemed to dissolve, and he saw a vague figure standing by the door, a figure only faintly limned and blocked in upon the darkness, mingled so with the folds of the drapery as to seem distorted, like a reflection seen in a dirty pane of glass.
With a sudden movement of fright or resolution John pressed the button by his bedside, and the next moment he was sitting in the green sunken bath of the adjoining room, waked into alertness by the shock of the cold water which half filled it.

He sprang out, and, his wet pajamas scattering a heavy trickle of water behind him, ran for the aquamarine door which he knew led out onto the ivory landing of the second floor. The door opened noiselessly. A single crimson lamp burning in a great dome above lit the magnificent sweep of the carved stairways with a poignant beauty. For a moment John hesitated, appalled by the silent splendor massed about him, seeming to envelop in its gigantic folds and contours the solitary drenched little figure shivering upon the ivory landing. Then simultaneously two things happened. The door of his own sitting-room swung open, precipitating three naked negroes into the hall--and, as John swayed in wild terror toward the stairway, another door slid back in the wall on the other side of the corridor, and John saw Braddock Washington standing in the lighted lift, wearing a fur coat and a pair of riding boots which reached to his knees and displayed, above, the glow of his rose-colored pajamas.

On the instant the three negroes--John had never seen any of them before, and it flashed through his mind that they must be the professional executioners--paused in their movement toward John, and turned expectantly to the man in the lift, who burst out with an imperious command:

"Get in here! All three of you! Quick as hell!"

Then, within the instant, the three negroes darted into the cage, the oblong of light was blotted out as the lift door slid shut, and John was again alone in the hall. He slumped weakly down against an ivory stair.

It was apparent that something portentous had occurred, something which, for the moment at least, had postponed his own petty disaster. What was it? Had the negroes risen in revolt? Had the aviators forced aside the iron bars of the grating? Or had the men of Fish stumbled blindly through the hills and gazed with bleak, joyless eyes upon the gaudy valley? John did not know. He heard a faint whir of air as the lift whizzed up again, and then, a moment later, as it descended. It was probable that Percy was hurrying to his father's assistance, and it occurred to John that this was his opportunity to join Kismine and plan an immediate escape. He waited until the lift had been silent for several minutes; shivering a little with the night cool that whipped in through his wet pajamas, he returned to his room and dressed himself quickly. Then he mounted a long flight of stairs and turned down the corridor carpeted with Russian sable which led to Kismine's suite.

The door of her sitting-room was open and the lamps were lighted. Kismine, in an angora kimono, stood near the window of the room in a listening attitude, and as John entered noiselessly she turned toward him.

"Oh, it's you!" she whispered, crossing the room to him. "Did you hear them?"

"I heard your father's slaves in my----"

"No," she interrupted excitedly. "Aeroplanes!"

"Aeroplanes? Perhaps that was the sound that woke me."

"There're at least a dozen. I saw one a few moments ago dead against the moon. The guard back by the cliff fired his rifle and that's what roused father. We're going to open on them right away."

"Are they here on purpose?"

"Yes--it's that Italian who got away----"

Simultaneously with her last word, a succession of sharp cracks tumbled in through the open window. Kismine uttered a little cry, took a penny with fumbling fingers from a box on her dresser, and ran to one of the electric lights. In an instant the entire ch_teau was in darkness--she had blown out the fuse.

"Come on!" she cried to him. "We'll go up to the roof garden, and watch it from there!"

Drawing a cape about her, she took his hand, and they found their way out the door. It was only a step to the tower lift, and as she pressed the button that shot them upward he put his arms around her in the darkness and kissed her mouth. Romance had come to John Unger at last. A minute later they had stepped out upon the star-white platform. Above, under the misty moon, sliding in and out of the patches of cloud that eddied below it, floated a dozen dark-winged bodies in a constant circling course. From here and there in the valley flashes of fire leaped toward them, followed by sharp detonations. Kismine clapped her hands with pleasure, which, a moment later, turned to dismay as the aeroplanes at some prearranged signal, began to release their bombs and the whole of the valley became a panorama of deep reverberate sound and lurid light.

Before long the aim of the attackers became concentrated upon the points where the anti-aircraft guns were situated, and one of them was almost immediately reduced to a giant cinder to lie smouldering in a park of rose bushes.

"Kismine," begged John, "you'll be glad when I tell you that this attack came on the eve of my murder. If I hadn't heard that guard shoot off his gun back by the pass I should now be stone dead----"

"I can't hear you!" cried Kismine, intent on the scene before her. "You'll have to talk louder!"

"I simply said, " shouted John, "that we'd better get out before they begin to shell the ch_teau!"

Suddenly the whole portico of the negro quarters cracked asunder, a geyser of flame shot up from under the colonnades, and great fragments of jagged marble were hurled as far as the borders of the lake.

"There go fifty thousand dollars' worth of slaves," cried Kismine, "at prewar prices. So few Americans have any respect for property."

John renewed his efforts to compel her to leave. The aim of the aeroplanes was becoming more precise minute by minute, and only two of the antiaircraft guns were still retaliating. It was obvious that the garrison, encircled with fire, could not hold out much longer.

"Come on!" cried John, pulling Kismine's arm, "we've got to go. Do you realize that those aviators will kill you without question if they find you ?"

She consented reluctantly.

"We'll have to wake Jasmine!" she said, as they hurried toward the lift. Then she added in a sort of childish delight: "We'll be poor, won't we? Like people in books. And I'll be an orphan and utterly free. Free and poor! What fun!" She stopped and raised her lips to him in a delighted kiss.

"It's impossible to be both together," said John grimly. "People have found that out. And I should choose to be free as preferable of the two. As an extra caution you'd better dump the contents of your jewel box into your pockets."

Ten minutes later the two girls met John in the dark corridor and they descended to the main floor of the ch_teau. Passing for the last time through the magnificence of the splendid halls, they stood for a moment out on the terrace, watching the burning negro quarters and the flaming embers of two planes which had fallen on the other side of the lake. A solitary gun was still keeping up a sturdy popping, and the attackers seemed timorous about descending lower, but sent their thunderous fireworks in a circle around it, until any chance shot might annihilate its Ethiopian crew.

John and the two sisters passed down the marble steps, turned sharply to the left, and began to ascend a narrow path that wound like a garter about the diamond mountain. Kismine knew a heavily wooded spot half-way up where they could lie concealed and yet be able to observe the wild night in the valley--finally to make an escape, when it should be necessary, along a secret path laid in a rocky gully.

X

IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK when they attained their destination. The obliging and phlegmatic Jasmine fell off to sleep immediately, leaning against the trunk of a large tree, while John and Kismine sat, his arm around her, and watched the desperate ebb and flow of the dying battle among the ruins of a vista that had been a garden spot that morning. Shortly after four o'clock the last remaining gun gave out a clanging sound and went out of action in a swift tongue of red smoke. Though the moon was down, they saw that the flying bodies were circling closer to the earth. When the planes had made certain that the beleaguered possessed no further resources, they would land and the dark and glittering reign of the Washingtons would be over.
With the cessation of the firing the valley grew quiet. The embers of the two aeroplanes glowed like the eyes of some monster crouching in the grass. The ch_teau stood dark and silent, beautiful without light as it had been beautiful in the sun, while the woody rattles of Nemesis filled the air above with a growing and receding complaint. Then John perceived that Kismine, like her sister, had fallen sound asleep.

It was long after four when he became aware of footsteps along the path they had lately followed, and he waited in breathless silence until the persons to whom they belonged had passed the vantage-point he occupied. There was a faint stir in the air now that was not of human origin, and the dew was cold; he knew that the dawn would break soon. John waited until the steps had gone a safe distance up the mountain and were inaudible. Then he followed. About half-way to the steep summit the trees fell away and a hard saddle of rock spread itself over the diamond beneath. Just before he reached this point he slowed down his pace, warned by an animal sense that there was life just ahead of him. Coming to a high boulder, he lifted his head gradually above its edge. His curiosity was rewarded; this is what he saw:

Braddock Washington was standing there motionless, silhouetted against the gray sky without sound or sign of life. As the dawn came up out of the east, lending a cold green color to the earth, it brought the solitary figure into insignificant contrast with the new day.

While John watched, his host remained for a few moments absorbed in some inscrutable contemplation; then he signalled to the two negroes who crouched at his feet to lift the burden which lay between them. As they struggled upright, the first yellow beam of the sun struck through the innumerable prisms of an immense and exquisitely chiselled diamond--and a white radiance was kindled that glowed upon the air like a fragment of the morning star. The bearers staggered beneath its weight for a moment--then their rippling muscles caught and hardened under the wet shine of the skins and the three figures were again motionless in their defiant impotency before the heavens.

After a while the white man lifted his head and slowly raised his arms in a gesture of attention, as one who would call a great crowd to hear--but there was no crowd, only the vast silence of the mountain and the sky, broken by faint bird voices down among the trees. The figure on the saddle of rock began to speak ponderously and with an inextinguishable pride.

"You out there--" he cried in a trembling voice. "You-- there--!" He paused, his arms still uplifted, his head held attentively as though he were expecting an answer. John strained his eyes to see whether there might be men coming down the mountain, but the mountain was bare of human life. There was only sky and a mocking flute of wind along the tree-tops. Could Washington be praying? For a moment John wondered. Then the illusion passed--there was something in the man's whole attitude antithetical to prayer.

"Oh, you above there!"

The voice was become strong and confident. This was no forlorn supplication. If anything, there was in it a quality of monstrous condescension.

"You there----"

Words, too quickly uttered to be understood, flowing one into the other. . . . John listened breathlessly, catching a phrase here and there, while the voice broke off, resumed, broke off again--now strong and argumentative, now colored with a slow, puzzled impatience. Then a conviction commenced to dawn on the single listener, and as realization crept over him a spray of quick blood rushed through his arteries. Braddock Washington was offering a bribe to God!

That was it--there was no doubt. The diamond in the arms of his slaves was some advance sample, a promise of more to follow.

That, John perceived after a time, was the thread running through his sentences. Prometheus Enriched was calling to witness forgotten sacrifices, forgotten rituals, prayers obsolete before the birth of Christ. For a while his discourse took the form of reminding God of this gift or that which Divinity had deigned to accept from men--great churches if he would rescue cities from the plague, gifts of myrrh and gold, of human lives and beautiful women and captive armies, of children and queens, of beasts of the forest and field, sheep and goats, harvests and cities, whole conquered lands that had been offered up in lust or blood for His appeasal, buying a meed's worth of alleviation from the Divine wrath--and now he, Braddock Washington, Emperor of Diamonds, king and priest of the age of gold, arbiter of splendor and luxury, would offer up a treasure such as princes before him had never dreamed of, offer it up not in suppliance, but in pride.

He would give to God, he continued, getting down to specifications, the greatest diamond in the world. This diamond would be cut with many more thousand facets than there were leaves on a tree, and yet the whole diamond would be shaped with the perfection of a stone no bigger than a fly. Many men would work upon it for many years. It would be set in a great dome of beaten gold, wonderfully carved and equipped with gates of opal and crusted sapphire. In the middle would be hollowed out a chapel presided over by an altar of iridescent, decomposing, ever-changing radium which would burn out the eyes of any worshipper who lifted up his head from prayer--and on this altar there would be slain for the amusement of the Divine Benefactor any victim He should choose, even though it should be the greatest and most powerful man alive.

In return he asked only a simple thing, a thing that for God would be absurdly easy--only that matters should be as they were yesterday at this hour and that they should so remain. So very simple! Let but the heavens open, swallowing these men and their aeroplanes--and then close again. Let him have his slaves once more, restored to life and well.

There was no one else with whom he had ever needed to treat or bargain.

He doubted only whether he had made his bribe big enough. God had His price, of course. God was made in man's image, so it had been said: He must have His price. And the price would be rare--no cathedral whose building consumed many years, no pyramid constructed by ten thousand workmen, would be like this cathedral, this pyramid.

He paused here. That was his proposition. Everything would be up to specifications and there was nothing vulgar in his assertion that it would be cheap at the price. He implied that Providence could take it or leave it.

As he approached the end his sentences became broken, became short and uncertain, and his body seemed tense, seemed strained to catch the slightest pressure or whisper of life in the spaces around him. His hair had turned gradually white as he talked, and now he lifted his head high to the heavens like a prophet of old--magnificently mad.

Then, as John stared in giddy fascination, it seemed to him that a curious phenomenon took place somewhere around him. It was as though the sky had darkened for an instant, as though there had been a sudden murmur in a gust of wind, a sound of far-away trumpets, a sighing like the rustle of a great silken robe--for a time the whole of nature round about partook of this darkness; the birds' song ceased; the trees were still, and far over the mountain there was a mutter of dull, menacing thunder.

That was all. The wind died along the tall grasses of the valley. The dawn and the day resumed their place in a time, and the risen sun sent hot waves of yellow mist that made its path bright before it. The leaves laughed in the sun, and their laughter shook the trees until each bough was like a girl's school in fairyland. God had refused to accept the bribe.

For another moment John watched the triumph of the day. Then, turning he saw a flutter of brown down by the lake, then another flutter, then another, like the dance of golden angels alighting from the clouds. The aeroplanes had come to earth.

John slid off the boulder and ran down the side of the mountain to the clump of trees, where the two girls were awake and waiting for him. Kismine sprang to her feet, the jewels in her pockets jingling, a question on her parted lips, but instinct told John that there was no time for words. They must get off the mountain without losing a moment. He seized a hand of each and in silence they threaded the tree-trunks, washed with light now and with the rising mist. Behind them from the valley came no sound at all, except the complaint of the peacocks far away and the pleasant undertone of morning.

When they had gone about half a mile, they avoided the park land and entered a narrow path that led over the next rise of ground. At the highest point of this they paused and turned around. Their eyes rested upon the mountainside they had just left--oppressed by some dark sense of tragic impendency.

Clear against the sky a broken, white-haired man was slowly descending the steep slope, followed by two gigantic and emotionless negroes, who carried a burden between them which still flashed and glittered in the sun. Half-way down two other figures joined them--John could see that they were Mrs. Washington and her son, upon whose arm she leaned. The aviators had clambered from their machines to the sweeping lawn in front of the ch_teau, and with rifles in hand were starting up the diamond mountain in skirmishing formation.

But the little group of five which had formed farther up and was engrossing all the watchers' attention had stopped upon a ledge of rock. The negroes stooped and pulled up what appeared to be a trap-door in the side of the mountain. Into this they all disappeared, the white-haired man first, then his wife and son, finally the two negroes, the glittering tips of whose jeweled head-dresses caught the sun for a moment before the trap-door descended and engulfed them all.

Kismine clutched John's arm.

"Oh," she cried wildly, "where are they going? What are they going to do?"

"It must be some underground way of escape "

A little scream from the two girls interrupted his sentence.

"Don't you see?" sobbed Kismine hysterically. "The mountain is wired!"

Even as she spoke John put up his hands to shield his sight. Before their eyes the whole surface of the mountain had changed suddenly to a dazzling burning yellow, which showed up through the jacket of turf as light shows through a human hand. For a moment the intolerable glow continued, and then like an extinguished filament it disappeared, revealing a black waste from which blue smoke arose slowly, carrying off with it what remained of vegetation and of human flesh. Of the aviators there was left neither blood, nor bone--they were consumed as completely as the five souls who had gone inside.

Simultaneously, and with an immense concussion, the ch_teau literally threw itself into the air, bursting into flaming fragments as it rose, and then tumbling back upon itself in a smoking pile that lay projecting half into the water of the lake. There was no fire--what smoke there was drifted off mingling with the sunshine, and for a few minutes longer a powdery dust of marble drifted from the great featureless pile that had once been the house of jewels. There was no more sound and the three people were alone in the valley.

XI

AT SUNSET John and his two companions reached the high cliff which had marked the boundaries of the Washingtons' dominion, and looking back found the valley tranquil and lovely in the dusk. They sat down to finish the food which Jasmine had brought with her in a basket.
"There!" she said, as she spread the table-cloth and put the sandwiches in a neat pile upon it. "Don't they look tempting? I always think that food tastes better outdoors."

"With that remark," remarked Kismine, "Jasmine enters the middle class."

"Now," said John eagerly, "turn out your pocket and let's see what jewels you brought along. If you made a good selection we three ought to live comfortably all the rest of our lives."

Obediently Kismine put her hand in her pocket and tossed two handfuls of glittering stones before him.

"Not so bad," cried John, enthusiastically. "They aren't very big, but-- Hello!" His expression changed as he held one of them up to the declining sun. "Why, these aren't diamonds! There's something the matter!"

"By golly!" exclaimed Kismine, with a startled look. "What an idiot I am!"

"Why, these are rhinestones!" cried John.

"I know." She broke into a laugh. "I opened the wrong drawer. They belonged on the dress of a girl who visited Jasmine. I got her to give them to me in exchange for diamonds. I'd never seen anything but precious stones before."

"And this is what you brought?"

"I'm afraid so." She fingered the brilliants wistfully. "I think I like these better. I'm a little tired of diamonds."

"Very well," said John gloomily. "We'll have to live in Hades. And you will grow old telling incredulous women that you got the wrong drawer. Unfortunately your father's bank-books were consumed with him."

"Well, what's the matter with Hades?"

"If I come home with a wife at my age my father is just as liable as not to cut me off with a hot coal, as they say down there."

Jasmine spoke up.

"I love washing," she said quietly. "I have always washed my own handkerchiefs. I'll take in laundry and support you both."

"Do they have washwomen in Hades?" asked Kismine innocently.

"Of course," answered John. "It's just like anywhere else."

"I thought--perhaps it was too hot to wear any clothes."

John laughed.

"Just try it!" he suggested. "They'll run you out before you're half started."

"Will father be there?" she asked.

John turned to her in astonishment.

"Your father is dead," he replied somberly. "Why should he go to Hades? You have it confused with another place that was abolished long ago."

After supper they folded up the table-cloth and spread their blankets for the night.

"What a dream it was," Kismine sighed, gazing up at the stars. "How strange it seems to be here with one dress and a penniless fianc_!

"Under the stars," she repeated. "I never noticed the stars before. I always thought of them as great big diamonds that belonged to some one. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream, all my youth."

"It was a dream," said John quietly. "Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness."

"How pleasant then to be insane!"

"So I'm told," said John gloomily. "I don't know any longer. At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That's a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it." He shivered. "Turn up your coat collar, little girl, the night's full of chill and you'll get pneumonia. His was a great sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours."

So wrapping himself in his blanket he fell off to sleep.13EmbedLe crime parfait (English Translation) Lyrics[Lyrics to "The Perfect Crime"]

[Verse 1]
No-no time to chat online, I asked my guys to grab him alive, I asked my guys to grab him alive
I asked my guys to grab him alive, on us, we already had little things (Seriously), but we were downright little
We-we-we are quickly upset, we are quickly determined, I'm handcuffed, I avoid being clear
Your wife wants to smack me if I avoid terms, basically, I wasn't supposed to please (Eh Gang)
Apparently, they want war, ok, we'll show you how it's done, family, keep an eye out
One is nеver better bеtrayed than by one's brother
Don't-don't-don't ask me if I fill the fridge, I'm the fridge
[Pre-Chorus]
I go to 'dam, kiss in Belgium, I pass the customs
With a girl, a baby seat, unsuspected mothers, small bags of CC, she snitch and goes to the table
Basically, it's normal, she's dead hungry, you paid her badly
I-I have ten kilos, I have ten cellphone, I'm not very far from the perfect crime

[Chorus]
State of emergency, it's a lethal weapon
A beautiful car riddled with bullets (Oh)
I have ten kilos, I have ten cellphone, I'm not very far from the perfect crime
State of emergency, it's a lethal weapon
A beautiful car riddled with bullets (Eh Gang)
I have ten kilos, I have ten cellphone, I'm not very far from the perfect crime
Zi-AK-47, Raspoutine (Gang), I'm not very far from the perfect crime (3endi sem fi dem)
I have ten kilos, I have ten cellphone, I'm not very far from the perfect crime
State of emergency, it's a lethal weapon
A beautiful car riddled with bullets (Oh)
I have ten kilos, I have ten cellphone, I'm not very far from the perfect crime (Ouh)

[Verse 2]
Cut a fucking guy, I made a cross on Clairefontaine
Drink a glass of rumpéi, smoke Popeye's green
The problem is that it's those who get screwed who give them advice
It's not a life, that's worse than the Play', to scare them a little, I have cartridges of sixteen
I don't choose, I take one of each (Mad, mad, mad, mad)
Headache, shut the fuck up and fill the bag (bag, bag, bag, bag,)
Fuck the state, I dont give a fuck, we stack (Gang), I need a lot of plates (Oh, oh, mad, mad, mad, mad)
H-H-H24 it's about Ziak, I have brand new friends who is looking for black

Rosé's vocals on the songs of BLACKPINK generally packs a punch and have a certain attitude to it. But, ever since hearing her part on the bridge of "Lovesick Girls", I was craving for the soulful and emotional side of it. And "Gone" delivered exactly that. When I first heard the teaser of the song, I was immediately in love with the melancholic and slow guitar strums, and the chorus was also already latched onto my mind. And when she performed the song on THE SHOW, it immеdiately solidified its position on my top favorite songs of all timе. Every time I hear the song, a breeze of nostalgia sweeps over me. And despite the lyrics talking about hardships and pain, it gives me warm waves of comfort.

- Nosyneko"Drunk-Dazed" - ENHYPENOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Admittedly, I am not the biggest fan of ENHYPEN; when Drunk-Dazed came out, I had already put the group off to the side, despite having watched the entirety of i-land. However, "Drunk-Dazed's" horror carnival concept really helped me hit the nail on defining what kind of a group ENHYPEN is; before, as a casual listener, I often felt as if ENHYPEN and other boy groups sometimes overlapped in sound and concept. "Drunk-Dazed" flowed very naturally and never lost the momentum gained by the bass starting in the first verse, despite the melodic verses, chorus, and bridge all sounding distinctively different. The chorus is simply phenomenal: the repetition of the lyrics conforms to the song's concept and makes you feel like you're stuck on a carnival ride, and the high pitched variations in the lyrics convey a wonderful anomaly to conformity, but never jarring nor frightening. The dynamic, yet sharp choreography of "Drunk-Dazed" takes the song one step further to showcase the ability of HYBE and ENHYPEN to seamlessly weave together the music and the arts.

- ANC613"Lose" - WONHOOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
It must have not been easy to make a comeback after releasing a debut song as good and powerful as “Open Mind,” but WONHO made it look so easy with the EDM pop-dance track “Lose.” Its catchy lyrics that play over the fast-paced instrumental and the easy-flowing voice of WONHO quickens the process of getting this song stuck in your head, as well as the cold-colored visuals in the music video that help magnify the creativeness of the choreography. Through this release that serves as an enjoyable ride, WONHO stays true to the classic-pop staple sound he’s proven to have mastered over his past releases, as he also promises to offer quality and dedication to his work.
- loveholic"0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You)" - TXT ft. SeoriOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
After the success of minisode1, came a new chapter for the group being FREEZE. Of course, being TXT, they experiment with each comeback and this one makes you go "Like oh my god, so holy". The lead song, "0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You)" is an emo rock style song with an anthemic and powerful instrumental. The amazing chorus and beat will definitely be one where you scream out the lyrics at the beginning of dusk, in the car (carefully, of course, safety is first), or vibing to it at 3 am to get in the feels. Just makes you wanna go like this. But don't be fooled by the melody, because the lyrics are truly on to break your heart. Being written and composed by Danke (lalala studio), “hitman” Bang, Melanie Joy Fontana, MOD SUN, RM & Slow Rabbit (just to name a few), it is surely one of the group's best songs yet! The lyrics are emotional and romantic centering on a person struggling for love. The strong concept and emotional lyrics are amplified by the hidden details in the music video. When it came out, you bet I was sobbing by the visuals of the music video and the lyrics. It made me fall in love with TXT all over again! Now then, better get back to something......."ˢᵃʸ ʸᵒᵘ ˡᵒᵛᵉ ᵐᵉ, ˢᵃʸ ʸᵒᵘ ˡᵒᵛᵉ ᵐᵉ...."

- Hobschiske"Alcohol-Free" - TWICEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Ever since "Fancy", TWICE keeps surprising us comeback after comeback by trying different sounds. After offering their own take on tropical house with "More & More", exploring a more retro, Dua Lipa-esque vibe on "I Can't Stop Me", and finally showing a darker side with "Cry for Me", they are now back with a summer song that feels really unique, "Alcohol-Free". The unexpected association of bossa nova with hip-hop (!) works amazingly well and creates a refreshing atmosphere that I haven't experienced in other K-pop songs. The members' vocals particularly shine, with smooth vocalizations at the end of each sentence. Listening to the track takes me away from my daily life for a while and I find myself chilling on a sunbed with a cocktail in hand – whether a mojito, margarita or alcohol-free – exactly what a good summer song is supposed to make you feel like, right?

- ab212"Beautiful Beautiful" - ONFOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
"Beautiful Beautiful" is straight-up 2016-2018 K-pop nostalgia, a.k.a my three favorite years of K-pop. This vocally driven track was the throwback I had been looking for for a long while. The refreshing vibe of the song and its colorful music video me feels like the intro to a video game, and reminds me of songs like "DNA," "Really Really," "Fancy" and "Anpanman." Personally, the best parts of this song are the Intro and the Bridge, the two most vocally driven parts of the song; the bridge especially had my attention for the incorporation of some good old beatboxing. It's a
reminder to me that good vocal technique and colorful songs like "Beautiful Beautiful" still have a persisting footing in K-pop. From the dramatic piano in "사랑하게 될 거야 (We Must Love)" to the playful vocals of "Beautiful Beautiful," ONF definitely has my attention.

- ANC613"Troll" - IU ft. DEANOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Marking my favorite dynamic duo’s highly anticipated collaboration, “Troll” sees IU and DEAN tell the familiar tale of two lovestruck exes who are not quite over each other. Sprinkled with sweet melodies, the song begins with IU’s light, euphonious vocals that detail her honest confessions. Lyrics that instantly stand out to me are present in verse 1, which translate to: “You can come without letting me know / You can mess up my day.” Personally, these lines elucidate just how hopelessly in love IU is; perhaps they are a little nostalgic for some. Effortlessly, verse 2 showcases DEAN’s soothing vocals which highlight his nonchalant perspective on the relationship. Honestly, the song feels like it’s somewhat of a prequel to April 2017’s “Can’t Love You Anymore,” as if it were explaining the backstory to how such intense feelings of love slowly burnt out. Overall, the song evokes foregone memories of my youth and is reminiscent of the cool, refreshing breeze felt on those long summer nights. Hopefully, this won’t be their only collaboration as the pair complement each other wonderfully!

- zealotofstockholm"BLUE" - TaeyongOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
As Taeyong began to release his self-written songs in March of this year, we’ve been gifted with a repertoire that varies in genres and show Taeyong’s pure artistry. In “BLUE,” Taeyong proved yet again how efficient and versatile of an artist he is, as he took on the challenge of trying out a rock-inspired sound that progressively and successfully grew to become a disclosure of Taeyong’s fresh emotions. But the lyrics of the song are what spoke the loudest to me; seeing an artist I’ve always looked up to come forward and offer us a look into his deepest thoughts while sharing soothing words really made me understand the impact music can have on one’s life. Through the powerful lessons taught by Taeyong and his raw vocals filled with both sentiment and vehemence, I found comfort in finding out that even the people I admire can sometimes feel the same way I do, and I truly do wish that as we gain energy from his encouraging words and eloquent storytelling, he can also find comfort in sharing his feelings with his TyongFs.

- loveholic"After School" - WeeeklyOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
If you don't know of Weeekly, you should at least know of "After School," the bubblegum pop K-Pop song that has been covered by thousands around the world in the newest of viral dance challenges. This success is astonishing for the group, who was not even a year old when the song blew up. I admit I started listening to "After School" after it went viral, but the song is memorable in more ways than one. As expected from a song titled "After School," the lyrics are filled with student life anecdotes – running through corridors, riding skateboards, and hanging out with friends while recording every moment for long-lasting memories. Overall, the song is reminiscent of all the freedoms of being a teenager before moving onto the next stages of life. Though a bright song, all this mention of being free brings upon some nostalgia. High school is the peak moment of freedom in many lives, and many memories from high school last a lifetime. But what about high schoolers today? In March 2021 (when the song was released), most teenagers around the world were being taught online, trapped inside of their homes. Students are supposed to be experiencing the freest years of their lives, but being trapped inside their houses twenty-four hours a day is making them miss out on the whole experience. A bright song like "After School," also sung by some young adults/teenagers can help raise the spirits. Students should have hope for the end of the pandemic when they can be freer and live the real school experience.

- PlanNine16"First" - EVERGLOWOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
For girl groups with powerful concepts, EVERGLOW is a name that should come to mind. The sextet has explored many different genres, such as powerful military-style "Adios" and retro "La Di Da." With "FIRST," EVERGLOW continues to prove they are aiming for the top, while also being the "firsts" exploring varieties of power concepts. "FIRST" is a powerful trap-EDM track that makes me feel like I'm about to face off against the final boss in a video game (which may as well be EVERGLOW). The song is so much in EVERGLOW's style and it does a good take at showing off the girls' talents. Newly appointed leader Sihyeon got a big share of the vocal parts, allowing her to show off her vocals alongside Mia. Onda, lacking recognition throughout their career, got the center position for the dance break. Aisha and Yiren made the stage theirs with their amazing charisma. And last but not least, main rapper E:U, with only two (fire) bars in the whole song, added the last bit of spice needed to make "FIRST" one of the most powerful addicting songs of 2021 so far.

- PlanNine16"Butter" - BTSOriginal Song
I was very excited and looked forward to "Butter" as soon as BTS announced its release.  And as I thought, they didn't disappoint me. It was a great song and I can't stop listening to it ever since.  For me, the best part of the song is the chorus & verse 3 (especially SUGA's rap part), I also love the instrumental part after the second chorus. RM's songwriting made the song feel even more personal. I believe this song has better proved BTS' success and it showed how perfect BTS are. The music video is a visual treat and all the members looked amazing. With "Butter," BTS has once again given us fans a summer anthem to vibe all year long.

- aAOfficial"I Wish" - Jimmy Brown & Sweet The KidOriginal Song
A collaboration project group that we never knew was going to happen, Jimmy Brown, Rovv and Sweet The Kid. Making a project group called The Good Days Boys and the trio released their first collaboration album includes, "i wish" as one of the title songs. Knowing how distinct Jimmy Brown's and Sweet The Kid's styles are, made me wonder how their songs will sound like on this collaboration. Through this song, both artists show their different styles of sexy R&B with simple lyrics and repetitive lines of "I wish, I'm wishin'" as their addictive chorus enhancing the chemistry between them. This EP is the second collaboration project that Jimmy Brown has started in 2021, and the next volume was recently released on June 27th.

- sa44"Dun Dun Dance" - OH MY GIRLOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
After their major successes in 2020 with "Nonstop" and "Dolphin," OH MY GIRL confidently returned to the stage this spring with "Dun Dun Dance." The song follows the route that "Nonstop" paved for the group, incorporating a lot more pop-dance elements than their previous releases which were softer and vocal-heavy. "Dun Dun Dance" also includes some retro and nu-disco elements, which were popularised in K-Pop last year. This shift in genre not only got them more popularity and attention, but it allows the group to showcase a more well-rounded image. Since they are a vocally-heavy group, "Dun Dun Dance" has a number of vocal parts that show off the vocalists' talents well. In contrast, the group's one rapper Mimi is also given time to shine, with bouncy rap parts sprinkled throughout the song to create the ultimate jam. "Dun Dun Dance" really helped kick off my summer right – It's bright, fun, and of course, it makes you want to dance! So dun dun dance (Whatever that means)!

- PlanNine16"riBBon" - BamBamOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
"riBBon" simultaneously manages to be a safe beginning to GOT7 member BamBam's solo and a boomy track that has many unique elements. The production is very careful - very intentional. The majority of the time it's hi-hats with a rhythm heavily carried by the punchy bassline alone, but, during the refrain, the instrumental is briefly stripped down to simply snaps and angelic vocal layering. The pitch tuning in "here we go" is used to lead into the euphoric chorus (if you listen carefully, you'll notice a deeper edit is layered under). The outro is by far the most interesting and experimental part of the song - it's more erratic, containing heavy pitch tuning and adlibs. Little vocal samples are sprinkled in as well. This track was unpredictable in that the bridge felt as if it would build back up to the pace of the chorus - but it didn't. Instead, the track took a totally different direction. These production elements and BamBam's soft, yet powerful cadence holds it together. In the music video, "riBBon" references the wrapping of a present, but, in the song, it's most consistently pronounced as a play on "reborn" (apart from the direct reference to untying it). The lyrics are characteristic of a lovey-dovey ballad, but they represent the better version of himself and his music that he seeks to create after departing from JYP Entertainment - his artistic rebirth.  It's definitely something special! I haven't seen ANYTHING like it this year.

- ckr"Next Level" - aespaOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
After already being heralded as "monster rookies" thanks to their November 2020 song "Black Mamba," aespa truly shine on follow-up single "Next Level," which reimagines A$ton Wyld’s 2019 song of the same name. While "Black Mamba" served as more of an intro to aespa’s half-digital concept, "Next Level" lets Giselle and Karina show off their rap skills while Ningning and Winter highlight their fluttering vocals, with different sections of the song taking inspiration from different genres. It’s proof that the success of "Black Mamba" was more than just beginner’s luck, and that aespa is here to stay as one of the most promising new girl groups.

- VinylZombie_MCR"Film out" - BTSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Not everyone knows it, but BTS are masters in creating atmospheric soundtracks, and so it was this time. "Film out" is the fourth BTS' song made for the Japanese cinematography (after "Don't Leave Me," "Stay Gold," and "Your Eyes Tell"), and acts as the main theme for the film Signal: Long-Term Unsolved Case Investigation Team. This moving ballad, co-written by Jung Kook, really shows off their vocal abilities and proves that they can sing and rap in any language—the harmonies, the flows, not a single one feeling out of place in the song. The song is filled with emotions and soulful vocals, and I'm sure it'll have a special place in many hearts. Despite being sung in Japanese, it has topped the charts in over 100 countries, including the world's biggest music markets, such as the US, Japan, and the UK.
- Siannve"Fireworks (I'm The One)" - ATEEZOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Being the second entry in their ZERO: FEVER series, ATEEZ truly did not disappoint! As being part of their sort of "tradition" with the title tracks, "Fireworks (I'm The One)" was teased at the end of the preceding single, "THANXX". It just left us wanting to hear more of the song before it was even out! And man we were in for a treat! The title track has an EDM rhythm over the trap beat, and the lyrics really are fire! They aim to burn their own ashes from the false perceptions of the world to make a real fire (like in the concept photos of a dreamy world vs the burning underworld). Also loved seeing Hongjoong and Mingi participated in the songwriting for the track! Definitely, one to blast when you want to feel powerful!

- Hobschiske"End of the World" - EPIK HIGHOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
The golden voice of Korea (puns intended) teamed up with my favorite South Korean trio, Epik High, to sing this ballad, which is one of the best songs on Epik High Is Here 上, despite that the album is packed with high-quality music. The song asks, 'What if the end of the world comes? What will be the most important then?' what hits harder in uncertain times we are living in now. The rough rap of the questions asked paired with GSoul's soothing vocals really hits differently, and makes it feel even nostalgic. But this song, contrary to appearances, is not sad, and the conclusion is that after all, you have to dream, love and live life to the fullest, as if there was no tomorrow, even if the world is dark and things seems out of control.

- Siannve"꼬리 (TAIL)" - SUNMIOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
In 2019, legendary Korean diva and superstar, Uhm Jung Hwa, said in an interview that if she can see someone continuing her legacy, it would be Sunmi. With explosive sensuality on her 2021 single, "꼬리 (TAIL)," Sunmi definitely proved her right. I have loved Sunmi’s singles ever since she debuted in 2013 with "24시간이 모자라 (24 Hours)." With her recent singles, Sunmi grew popular as a witty lyricist with quirky songs and music videos. But with "꼬리 (TAIL)" Sunmi went back to her sultry second-generation sound and style bringing back the heat. Guitar riffs and looming vintage sound samples make the song an instant earworm with a sexy aura amplified by the equally sexy choreography. With "꼬리 (TAIL)," I think Sunmi is stepping into an even more mature image and establishing herself as a diva in the K-Pop industry.

- ssaa10dec"Joker" - BIG Naughty ft. JAMIEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
"Joker" is easily one of the best Korean songs this year. It was my first time hearing BIG Naughty, and the soulful guitar and emotional voice hooked me up instantly. In this bittersweet track, BIG Naughty sings about being head over heels for a girl who isn't serious about him. The concept is summed up in my favorite lines, "Even if I were a king or queen, I cannot defeat you 'cause you are the joker and I've already fallen for you." BIG Naughty also offers the other party's perspective with JAMIE's feature, explaining that she's just in it for the fun. With both sides of the story and expressive performances, the song is brought to life like a movie.

- EleventhCassette"치맛바람 (Chi Mat Ba Ram)" - Brave GirlsOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Brave Girls' story is probably the most heartwarming thing to happen in K-pop this year: on the verge of disbandment after years of poor recognition, the group unexpectedly found late success with their 2017 tropical pop song "Rollin'" going viral and breaking records; turning them into the hottest girl group of 2021 and strong contenders for the 'summer queens' position left vacant by SISTAR. Now that all eyes are on them, expectations were high for their comeback, and "Chi Mat Ba Ram" did not disappoint: while sharing the same high energy and top-quality production of "Rollin'", it is far from being a pale copy and succeeds at giving off a different vibe, highlighting even better each member's charms. Reminiscent of second-gen girl groups songs, it stills feels very now and sets up an exciting summer mood from the get-go. As they confidently sing "We're gonna be summer queens, yeah", I couldn't think of a more deserving group to take on this spot.

- ab212"Lock Down" - EPEXOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
What you'll notice when listening to "Lock Down" is the high-energy trap instrumental and smooth rapping. It seems like a braggadocious celebration of a lavish lifestyle on first listen - and you'd be forgiven to think so. But what you'll discover as you look into the lyrics is that it's a critique of the worship of wealth and unrealistic expectations that social media (such as Instagram) cultivates. The title clearly references COVID lockdowns, which further exacerbated these problems as people turned to the internet for most or all social interaction. People often present the best parts of their life - or "mask up." While this can be taken literally with the normalcy of face masks, it acts as more of a metaphor for the image seen on social media. EPEX tackles how this damages mental health - fostering envy, jealousy, and hatred. Influencers oftentimes value brands and interesting drama to keep people enticed over meaningful friendships. But this isn't their fault. In fact, it refers to social media companies as "Big Brother" manipulating you (for example, the dopamine from receiving comments, likes, or other interaction). It maximizes engagement, on purpose, to an obsessive level. The question it begs is: what are you willing to sacrifice for money, fame, and social validation? People who don't cave are left hopeless because so many do. Nowadays, someone's life can be entertainment like never before with every little thing recorded and documented for the world. "Lock Down" is amazing in presentation and production (which I usually praise), but the deep lyrical complexity is something remarkable. This is paired with the refreshing fact that a rookie group is targeting such a serious issue on debut.

- ckr"Nerves" - DPR IANOriginal Song | Korean Translation
If I had the option to write about every song in MITO, I honestly would—the album is just perfect from start to finish. I ended up choosing "Nerves" because the songwriting is absolutely genius (No pun intended). Like the title hints, DPR IAN expresses his nervousness through repetitive phrases and self-convincing. It's almost like trying to write a risky text, where you keep erasing and changing your words due to insecurity. After hitting 'SEND', you end up in regret for not saying your true feelings.

- EleventhCassette"우리의 계절 (My Youth)" - NCT DREAMOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
"우리의 계절 (My Youth)" is my favorite song out of NCT DREAM's first full-length album; not only does it include beautiful joyful vocals that the members can very smoothly execute live while making it look like they ate the CD before performing it, but it also features the slight hint of nostalgia that nobody but NCT DREAM can do. Being a long-time fan of the group, I can't deny that the sentimental lyrics hit close to home as they made me realize that all of this time, as I left my teenage years and went into adulthood while supporting them, I've also been sharing my youth and growing up with them. Accompanied by a chill electro-pop sound that enhances the group's signature youthful concept, "우리의 계절 (My Youth)" is a sweet reminder of how we can finally see them all together yet again, making new memories while prospering, breaking new records, and sharing their journey with us, their fans.

- loveholic"Odd Eye" - DREAMCATCHEROriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
In late January, DREAMCATCHER came back in full force with their title track "Odd Eye" from their EP Dystopia: Road To Utopia, the end of their 'Dystopia' trilogy. "Odd Eye" starts off with strong and mysterious melodies, the lyrics portraying how humans keep chasing a perfect world that doesn't exist—a Utopia. The pre-chorus builds the song up with haunting synth sounds until the chorus drops with one of the coolest guitar riffs ever. As a breaker, Dami's rap verse has a more electronic vibe, and my favorite lyrics in the song, "Struggling with meaninglessness, we seemed to be in the same place again with endless thirst. No matter how you chase a mirage, it's not there." In the bridge, I always imagine that's how DREAMCATCHER would sound like after a big explosion, a breaking point where they've realized their reality and lost all hope. I love the choreography at this part, leading to the girls' powerful spinning jump in the last chorus. Vocally, the highlights there are Yoohyeon's and Siyeons's harmonies and backing vocals, landing the song to a breathtaking end. Besides the musical aspect of the track, the music video for "Odd Eye" is the best film release of DREAMCATCHER so far. The girl group has always had great music video concepts, but now they've perfected them with amazing direction, special effects, artsy sets, and cyberpunk imagery. With the conclusion of the 'Dystopia' series, I can't wait to see what else DREAMCATCHER has in store for us.

- EleventhCassette"Don't Fight The Feeling" - EXOOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Undoubtedly my excitement had been reaching new heights ever since EXO’s comeback was announced in April. LAY’s involvement in the project amplified it further. “Don’t Fight The Feeling” is a perfect comeback title track. While I love EXO’s experimental tracks like “Tempo” and “Obsession,” I was longing for a simple dance-pop track from the group. The song and its colorful music video is one giant dance party and gave me the same feeling as when I heard their 2018 anthem, "Power" or their 2015 bop, "Love Me Right." A very easy listen, the song is perfect for everyone’s summer playlists. With lyrics about enjoying life on your own terms, the new song, and its parent album, EXO once again prove that they can still have fun while being sincere.

- ssaa10dec"Healer" - DAY6Original Song | Romanization | English Translation
At first glance, the title “Healer” might hint at a soothing, mellow song … but what follows is a musical surprise that is pure joy to listen to! DAY6 is renowned for consistently delivering hits, and “Healer” is no exception. With an up-tempo and bright sound, “Healer” mixes electropop and rock (along with some DAY6 magic) and simultaneously manages to make the listener feel soothed and energized all at once. Young K’s lyrics perfectly encapsulate the effects of someone’s healing presence in your life. Lagging in energy? Feeling down? Missing someone? Or feeling good about life? Listen to “Healer” (on repeat)! Caution: head-bopping may ensue. “Healer” is my most played song thus far in 2021 and is apt to retain that title for the rest of the year. Thank you DAY6 for this soothing, healing, and energizing song!

- minnowli"왜왜왜 (Why Why Why)" - iKONOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Even though iKON is known for their crazy banging hip-hop tracks, I expected “왜왜왜 (Why Why Why)” to be a complete ballad. However, they delivered one of 2021’s best heartbreak anthems without it being a piano ballad. I am a sucker for angsty boy group songs and iKON shared one of the best songs of their career. The track was an instant throwback to old YG ballads. With an absolutely beautiful melody, an emotive rap verse by Bobby, sleek choreography, and somber music video, “왜왜왜 (Why Why Why)” has the longevity of most iKON songs. I believe I will revisit this track in a few years and fall in love with it all over again. I also hope iKON gains a renewed popularity following their appearance on KINGDOM.

- ssaa10dec"PTT (Paint The Town)" - LOONAOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
"PTT (Paint The Town)" is probably the song that I was most excited about so far this year (alongside "Like It Hot" by GWSN). It was really exciting since member Haseul, who was put on hiatus for over a year, was returning. This was my first comeback with her and it definitely made me like the song more. The song features a catchy Bollywood instrumental and honestly was really different from what I expected. The bridge along with the pre-chorus were the best parts of the song in my opinion. I also adore the part that Go Won and Vivi share. There is also a Japanese version of the song, so if you enjoy listening to J-pop more, I would recommend that version. The chorus has an easy-to-listen beat drop which compliments the piece a lot. The lyrics to this song provide confidence as LOONA always has inspiring lyrics that will make you feel like a badass. "PTT (Paint The Town)" is a song that I'd recommend if you enjoy strong concepts.

- seokyoung"Spider" - HOSHIOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
It is kind of hard for me to believe that “Spider” is Hoshi’s first proper solo release. Hoshi’s command throughout the song and the track’s ability to lure in its listeners like a spider to its prey is one of the many reasons why I love the song. Weaved over a sultry electric guitar, “Spider” lets Hoshi shine not only as a performer but also as a vocalist. With 13 members in the group, Seventeen songs often struggle with the vocal part distribution. With a solo release, Hoshi is once again able to remind listeners of his talent as a singer. The music video and the song’s insane choreography are other highlights of this debut for me. From his forehead (God bless his stylist) to the upside-down acrobatics, the music video was filled with moments that fans can instantly fall in love with. With “Spider,” Hoshi proves why he was chosen as the performance leader in Seventeen and also makes his impact as a soloist with tremendous potential.

- ssaa10dec"Giant"/"Bonnie & Clyde" - YuqiOriginal Song | Chinese Translation
“Giant” and “Bonnie & Clyde” were the first solo songs I listened to by a (G)-IDLE member and I was blown away. Yuqi's first single album featuring the rock-inspired song, "Giant" and disco-pop, "Bonnie & Clyde" perfectly showcase her powerful vocals and husky voice. The build-up to the chorus in “Giant” gives just the right amount of suspense to draw the listener in while leaving them yearning for more. I love how the chorus’ lyrics, while repetitive, can be seen as a mantra for anyone struggling and it’s paired with a strong beat — giving the song a powerful fighting spirit. Contrasting “Giant”, the EDM-trance track, “Bonnie & Clyde” incorporates haunting energy that leads to a power-packed chorus. A set of chords pulse throughout the song giving it looping energy that makes the song so addictive.
