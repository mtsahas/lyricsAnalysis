The Kids Donâ€™t Wanna Come Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know what I want if I'm completely honest
I guess I could start a war, I guess I could sleep on it
I don't know what I want if I'm completely honest
I guess I could start a war, I guess I could sleep on it

[Pre-Chorus]
But hey there, kids with guns
Your neighbours complain, but they don't know where they come from
I guess it's just bad advice for someone so upstanding
So maybe just ask them twice or be a bit demanding
[Chorus]
You don't know how to give love to anyone
You don't know how to pretend
You told your kids that they'd live long forever
But the kids don't wanna come home again
No, the kids don't wanna come home again

[Verse 2]
Haven't you any shame? Have you got no morals?
Teaching them how to aim, no sadness and no sorrow
Well hey there, mother o' mine
Your kids are sick, but they're gonna be just fine
I said possibly not if you keep raising them this way
You're just leading them to die, oh, your disbelief and dismay

[Pre-Chorus]
Well hey there, kids with guns
Your neighbours complain, but they don't know where they come from

[Chorus]
You don't know how to give love to anyone
You don't know how to pretend
You told your kids that they'd live long forever
But the kids don't wanna come home again
No, the kids don't wanna come home again
You might also like[Break]

[Chorus]
You don't know how to give love to anyone
You don't know how to pretend
You told your kids that they'd live long forever
But the kids don't wanna come home again
No, the kids don't wanna come home again
No, the kids don't wanna come home again
No, the kids don't wanna come home

[Spoken Outro]
What did you just write that song about?
"About, the kids don't wanna go home"
Well, they do now, don't they?
They don't
You don't, you don't wanna go home?
Then why did you write that whole song about it if we don't want to go home?
You want us to go home, but why did you write a song about how the kids don't wanna go home?
He just felt like it
I'm gonna, I'm gonna dip out
I'm gonna get you
Are we going back in?
I'm gonna get you
Drop the mic
Just shut up
I'm gonna get you
