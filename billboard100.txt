We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn

Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I

I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said

Ooh, I didn't wanna leave you, baby, I didn't wanna fight
Started to cry, but then remembered I

Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night

I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' about life goin' sip for sip, yeah
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me
I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You called your momma, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull her right back up
Yeah my, my friends say "Let her go"
Your friends say "What the hell?"
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else

Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can’t remember everything we said but we said too much

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should, I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playin' on my patience
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will, I (I might)

If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Don't know where you at, don't know where you've been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie

When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?

But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all thе help I can get

Go buy a zip of weed, hit the club
Pay for 'bout ten niggas to get in
We crunk, lit, in this bitch, yeah
Know we walk around the world
Steppin', not givin a damn 'bout where our feet land at, yeah
Get your ass mushed, smooshed (6ix)
Yeah, 21, the biggest
Put a nigga in the chicken wing, pussy
21, can you do somethin' for me? (21)
Can you hit a lil' rich flex for me? (21)
And 21, can you do somethin' for me? (21, 21)
Drop some bars to my pussy ex for me
Then 21 (21), can you do somethin' for me? (Yeah)
Can you talk to the opps necks for me? (Okay)
21, do your thing 21, do your thing (21)
Do your thing, 21, do your thing

Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21, 21)
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your ho a flea (Fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)
Paid like an athlete, I got—
You might also like
All you hoes, all of you hoes need to remember who y'all talkin' to
It's a Slaughter Gang CEO
I got dick for you if I'm not workin', girl
If I'm busy then fuck no
You need to find you someone else to call
When your bank account get low, you need to find you someone—


Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm on that Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit, ayy

Sticks and stones, chrome on chrome
That's just what a nigga on
Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Nan' nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing BNE
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then its BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy
Ah, what, what
Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
On God
Boy, look, you the motherfuckin' man, boy, you, ooh
You is the man, you hear me?28EmbedFebruary 2023 Singles Release Calendar Lyrics2/1

Some things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie them up and leave 'em
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go

Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field home run ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone
I can say it wasn't meant to be
But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting go
Change the way the river flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind

Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone


She ain't got one bit of stick around
There's no sense in tryin' to slow her down

Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone

It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

A little bit of love is all that it's needin'
But it's good as it is tough

Everybody's asking what the hell happened
Wondering why it all went wrong
Mama always said if you can't say something nice
Then don't say anything at all
I've got my side of the story and he's got his side, too
And I ain't gonna go and tell you what he did
But I'll tell you what he didn't do

Treat me right, put me first, be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
And always fight for my love, hold on tight like it's something
That he couldn't stand to lose
The devil's in the details
I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the еnd, it wasn't what he did, no
It was what he didn't do
I'm already halfway ovеr him and I ain't taking time to turn around
And I'ma take the high road, even though we both know
I could run him out of this town
That's just dirty laundry, I don't need to wear the truth
So I ain't gonna tell you everything he did
But I'll tell you what he didn't do

Wipe him like he snotty for you, baby girl

Damn, just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school
Are makin' laws about what women can do
I gotta protect ya, I'm a made man, tied in, all the way, baby
So I gotta respect ya
Niggas put hands on you in the past, insecure because your body is precious
Four words when I think about them is crusty, musty, dusty, rusty
Eight words when I think about us is fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Disrespect ya and I'll smack 'em
The texts that you send in captions
The videos we got ever leak, we goin' viral or goin' platinum
Don't worry 'bout your friend's story when I had her alone
She gon' try and put some extras on it, take you out of your zone
You know how it goes when they can't get a reservation up in Carbone
They gon' tell you it's a chill night, tell you how they'd rather stay home, yeah
Jealous-ass hoes, yeah
And I know what I said 'bout bein' in Vogue
But just like that R&B group from the '90s
Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue
One call, you in runway shows
One call, I'm sittin' front row
One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home
One call and my niggas ten toes
Down to go wherever I say go
Even if we gotta travel 'cross the globe
Down to take you to the end of the road, for real

Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

I'll dance, dance, dance

Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because

I won't cry for you, see (See)
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary

Liberdade e amor28EmbedTranslationsFrançaisEnglishEspañolPortuguês​golden hour Lyrics
It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, "Where you at tonight?"
Got no alibi

I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Workin' my way through a middle of June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was somethin' in the headlights
That stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death
So I said, "Climb in," and in she climbed
Oh, yeah
Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through еnough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
"Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck"

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reachin' for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smokin' one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come

It's been sixty months and she still comes
To see me from time to time
It was worth the price to see a brighter side
Of the girl I picked up that night
And I might be here forever
It ain't paradise, that's true
But it's a whole hell of a lot better
Than the place I sent him to

Get to do something I love
And I make it home every evening
To an angel God sent from above
Got an eight point on camera from last year
That this season looks like a ten
I got a barn with a fridge full of cold beer
On the weekend it's full of good friends

I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?
I got a half ton that's parked in the driveway
My dog wags his tail when he hears
I grew up in a good place to be from
My folks still got a bunch of good years

Now I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand

Backin' down the ramp in my old truck

To catch a bunch of hogs

If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book
But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red

I met a good girl she had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up

Got me over my first wife

God made the world in seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said, "Please, Lord, if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms"
So God made a girl, His best work of art

I hate that I love the way them kisses taste like whiskey
How they wake up, take on off, and not even miss me
Leave this heart broken, holdin' that smokin' gun
I guess that's just the way them wild horses run
Let 'em run

Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world

You swear that you're stayin' single, next thing you know
You meet a girl at a bar and next thing you know
You get her laughin', it's 2 a.m
You're tellin' your buddies, three months in
Then she ain't movin' in, the next thing you know
There's a U-Haul trailer, the next thing you know
Your old apartment, is y'all's new place
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays

Next thing you know
You're savin' money like never before, just to
Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on onе knee on her mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, "No"
Next thing you know
Your bеst man gives a half-drunk speech and you're
Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your
Left hand's gettin' used to that ring
And there the next two or three years go
Next thing you know
You weren't really tryin', next thing you know
There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death

'Cause next thing you know
You're wearin' scrubs and a funny white hat and the
Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and
Nobody's ever called you that
And you take that drive home slow
Next thing you know
It's first steps, first dates, first car
It's 11:01 wonderin' where they are
You're sayin' that USC's too far
It's amazing how fast seventeen years go
Next thing you know

Next thing you know
You get to know your wife again and you're
More in love than you've ever been
With a lot of years of remember when's and still some down the road

Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before
Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

But it's not real
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before

She never wanted to be white-picket fenced in
Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun
But here she is, free, lyin' next to me
'Cause I ain't tryna tame her love

I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't livin' for a diamond ring
Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out loud
We're burnin' it down
Blazin' up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
Yeah, that's where she calls home

I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her

I remember sittin' at that house, livin' room couch
Thinkin' no way them boys wouldn't win
Between them big three pitchers, Andruw and Chipper
It was gonna be hard to keep up with the Jones's
But as fate would have it, that Atlanta magic
Got put out by them damn Padres
I guess destiny ain't always meant to be
Kinda like you and me that day

We got close, but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run, to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences and came up short
Yeah, you win some, you lose some, it ain't always home runs
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
Had that whole town believin'
Damn, girl, I even had that talk to your dad, man to man
But just like that season
Girl, you and me didn't end with a ring on a hand

We got close, but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run, to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences, and came up short
Yeah, you win some, you lose some, it ain't always home runs
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team, and love was a game

आज सुबह उठा किसी वीडियो में
कुछ के बारे में बात करना जो मैंने एक वीडियो में पोस्ट किया है
अगर मैं ना होता तो क्या तुम्हे भी बुरा लगता
या सिर्फ इसलिए कि मैं काला और भारी हूँ? हालांकि आप सभी मुझे नहीं सुनते
[जब से मैं बिस्सोनेट पर धीमी गति से गाड़ी चला रहा हूं, तब से मैं वही रहा हूं
मुझे पता है कि किसी को भी फोन करें और वे आपको बताएंगे कि] (25847163)
प्रसिद्ध, सुंदर, नया, लेकिन मुझे लोगों को जज करने की आदत हो गई है
इसलिए मैं जिस तरह से चलता हूं, उसी तरह चलता हूं और मुझे मुझसे इतना प्यार क्यों है
मुझे अकेलापन महसूस करने की आदत है, ओह
तो, मैंने सोचा कि मैं आपको बता दूं

अगर आज आपको किसी ने नहीं बताया, तो आप खास हैं (विशेष)
यदि किसी ने आपको विश्वास नहीं दिलाया, तो आप विशेष (विशेष) हैं
खैर, मैं हमेशा तुमसे यही कहूंगा, तुम खास हो

और आप किसी लड़की को रद्द कर सकते हैं क्योंकि वह सिर्फ बदलना चाहती थी

इसलिए हम इतना अकेला महसूस करते हैं, इसलिए हमें बहुत शर्म आती है, हम्म

I'm starvin', darlin'
Let me put my lips to something
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carvin', darlin'
I wanna smell the dinner cookin'
I wanna feel the edges start to burn

Honey, I wanna race you to the table
If you hesitate, the gettin' is gone
I won't lie if there's somethin' to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever's still to come
Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinnin' the children for a war drum
Puttin' food on the table sellin' bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young


You can't buy this fineness
Let me see the heat get to you
Let me watch the dressing start to peel
It's a kindness, highness
Crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal

Honey, I'm makin' sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie if there's somethin' still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come

Mama, I'm callin', I've got some news
Don't you tell Daddy, he'll blow a fuse
Don't worry, I'm doin' okay
I know you raised me to know right from wrong
It ain't what you think and I'm still writin' songs
Just never thought I'd see the day
I've never felt this way

I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him
Took me to Knoxville last Saturday
And I wore the hat on his dash to the game
It sure wasn't Athens, but I
Fell for him under those Neyland lights

I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

Mama, forgive me, I like him a lot
Hell, I'm learnin' the words to "Old Rocky Top"
He's got a smile that makes me forget
I've always looked better in red

But I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
And I still want the Dawgs to win
But I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh

Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-blee"
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me)

I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

I'm talkin' all around the clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks

De todo ya pasé, claro que le batallé

Lo que un día soñé, todo ya me lo compré

Muy bueno para las cuentas, todo apunto en la libreta

Pura morrita bien buena, montada en mi camioneta
Los radios suenan y suenan, pero yo siempre ando alerta, eah

Puerto de Mazatlán, divisando la ciudad
En jеt particular, me pongo en cualquier lugar
Destapando las champagne, hay billetes pa' gastar
Moviendo bien el ice, everywhere me han de mirar
Con unos tenis Nike, soy maleante y es lo que hay

Cuando por las noches recordaba todo
El olor de aquel perfume sobre todo
Las sábanas blancas donde te escondías dentro
Eres intocable como joya de oro
Esas piernas largas comerme yo solo
Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto
Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejará
Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida, ah, ah
Como tú no hay nadie más
No hay nadie más
Ah
¿Y qué?
Si te sientes sola no me llames porfa
Me pongo sensible, me imagino tu sombra
Clase Azul es el tequila e interior la ropa
Rico Prat champaña, el polvo es color rosa
Me contactó un ángel, eres tú mi hermosa
La que me alegra los días y sigo tomando

Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejarás

I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah

How we get so deep so fast?
Bae, stop playin', I'll beat your ass
You be on some toxic shit but I cannot get off this bitch, I
Haven't seen you in three months, I miss you, can I see you, bae?
Every time I see one of your pictures, that shit drives me crazy
Girl, I know you miss a nigga
Especially how I kiss it
Message say delivered
Why the fuck you keep goin' missing on me?
Every time he get back in the picture, you act different on me
Ayy, tell that nigga we gon' have to share you, I ain't trippin' on it
One more time might be the best for both of us
Maybe we should talk about it later when we sober up
Maybe we should keep it goin', maybe we should let it go
Feel like if it's meant it's what it is so just let it flow
Got somethin' to handle so I'ma be here for a couple hours
Figured out you like them, my assistant keep on sendin' flowers
They got they own business, tell me why the fuck they all in ours?
Mama raised a lot of things but she ain't raised no fuckin' coward
We went to the moon last time, I'm tryna go back
We been doin' our thing for a while but they don't know that
I be buyin' you all type of bags but you can't show that
I be playin' the cut until you come back
I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah

Thinkin' how we played out
Really I feel off about it but ain't never said it
We ain't gotta talk about it
They'll never know when I'm with you, I play a different role
Can't move off emotion, this shit deep now I got self-control
I ain't never tried to hold you, niggas try to high and low me
I can break it down in dumbest terms and show you how you owe me
Still try and back door me, I know how to go about it
I know everything but I treat you like I don't know about it
Wildin' in Skyami, we took shrooms and caught a different vibe
Bitches can't fuck with you, you the one, for real, I peep your style
I gotta get to it, I'm OT so it's gon' be a while
It feel a lil' better when I ain't seen you, yeah

I know you miss me

El Himno Nacional Mexicano es uno de los tres símbolos patrios oficiales de México. Pese a conocerse y usarse como tal desde 1854, solo se hizo oficial desde 1943 a partir de un decreto expedido por el presidente Manuel Ávila Camacho.
La letra del himno alude a victorias mexicanas en batallas y trata sobre la defensa de la patria. Sus estrofas y estribillo fueron compuestas por el poeta potosino Francisco González Bocanegra en 1853, mientras que su música, obra del músico español Jaime Nunó, fue compuesta al año siguiente.
En su versión original, el himno está compuesto por diez estrofas, pero en los noventa años que pasó para su oficialización pasó por varias modificaciones o intentos de modificación, quedando reducido solo a cuatro estrofas y el estribillo a partir de 1943, cuando fue oficializado.

Las características y uso del Himno Nacional Mexicano está regulada por la “Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales” en sus artículos 1, 4, Capítulo V de los artículos 38 a 49, y el Capítulo Especial de los artículos 57 a 60. Y se menciona que el texto del himno y partitura de la música se encuentran autentificados por firma de los titulares de los poderes federales, en una copia triple que se deposita para su resguardo en el Archivo General de la Nación, en la Biblioteca Nacional y en el Museo Nacional de Historia.
Letra
La letra oficial del himno mexicano se compone de cuatro estrofas y un estribillo como marca el artículo 57 de la citada ley y esas estrofas y estribillo son:
Coro
Mexicanos, al grito de guerra
El acero aprestad y el bridón;
Y retiemble en sus centros la tierra
Al sonoro rugir del cañón.
Y retiemble en sus centros la tierra
Al sonoro rugir del cañón.
Estrofas
I
Ciña ¡Oh Patria! tus sienes de oliva
de la paz el arcángel divino,
que en el cielo tu eterno destino
por el dedo de Dios se escribió.
Mas si osare un extraño enemigo
profanar con su planta tu suelo,
piensa ¡Oh Patria querida! que el cielo
un soldado en cada hijo te dio.
V
¡Guerra, guerra sin tregua al que intente
de la patria manchar los blasones!,
¡guerra, guerra! los patrios pendones
en las olas de sangre empapad.
¡Guerra, guerra! en el monte, en el valle,
los cañones horrísonos truenen
y los ecos sonoros resuenen
con las voces de ¡Unión! ¡Libertad!
VI
Antes, Patria, que inermes tus hijos
bajo el yugo su cuello dobleguen,
tus campiñas con sangre se rieguen,
sobre sangre se estampe su pie.
Y tus templos, palacios y torres
se derrumben con hórrido estruendo,
y sus ruinas existan diciendo:
de mil héroes la Patria aquí fue.
X
¡Patria! ¡Patria! tus hijos te juran
exhalar en tus aras su aliento,
si el clarín con su bélico acento
los convoca a lidiar con valor.
¡Para ti las guirnaldas de oliva!
¡un recuerdo para ellos de gloria!
¡un laurel para ti de victoria!
¡un sepulcro para ellos de honor!
Oficialmente en 1943 el texto del himno nacional fue completamente publicado con sus diez estrofas y estribillo, pero algunas se recortaron porque hacían referencia a Santa Anna, por eso se recortó a solo cuatro estrofas que son las estrofas I, V, VI y X, de la versión original y el estribillo. La modificación de la letra fue ordenada primero por el Presidente Manuel Ávila Camacho pero solo se oficializó en 1984 por el Presidente Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado a las cuatro estrofas con el fin de hacerlo más fácil de interpretar.
Música
En el Capítulo Especial, Artículo 58 de la Ley se presenta una copia de la partitura de la música del Himno, consistente básicamente en dos partes: una para el estribillo y otra para las estrofas.
Primera página de la partitura y letra.
Segunda página de la partitura y letra.

Interpretación
La forma de interpretar el himno es como sigue:
Estribillo, Estrofa I, Estribillo, Estrofa II, Estribillo, Estrofa III, Estribillo, Estrofa IV, Estribillo.

Uso
En el artículo 42 de la Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales, se menciona que:
El Himno Nacional sólo se ejecutará, total o parcialmente, en actos solemnes de carácter oficial, cívico, cultural, escolar o deportivo, …
En el caso de las versiones parciales indica que en planteles escolares y eventos deportivos, tales como los Juegos Olímpicos, las únicas partes del himno que pueden interpretarse o reproducirse son estribillo y estrofa I. Otras salvedades son: para otros casos como los cierres y aperturas de trasmisiones de estaciones de radio o televisión, pueden alterar dentro de las cuatro estrofas oficiales y previa autorización de la Secretaría de Gobernación la versión que transmiten, aunque nunca pueden acortar las versiones completas que se producen durante ceremonias oficiales.
En ceremonias oficiales en territorio mexicano de instituciones públicas y privadas donde deba tocarse el Himno Nacional y otro extranjero, se ejecutará en primer lugar el mexicano; pero si existe un protocolo, como en los Juegos Olímpicos, se interpretará de acuerdo al orden que marque el protocolo correspondiente de ese acto.
Por otro lado su uso como distintivo de honor se ejecuta acompañado de otra música; por ejemplo; para hacer honores al Presidente de la República, las bandas militares presentes tocarán la «Marcha de Honor»; el caso de honores a la bandera, las bandas de música ejecutarán el himno y a la vez las bandas militares tocarán la marcha llamada «Bandera» y establece un límite a sus interpretaciones en ese caso, dos veces, para hacer honores a la Bandera y rendir honores al Presidente de la República. Aunque se indica la salvedad de que cuando sea interpretado por un coro las bandas militares deberán permanecer en silencio para apagar al coro.
En cualquier caso los presentes deberán demostrar el respecto asumiendo la posición de firme y en caso de que existan varones deben tener la cabeza descubierta, salvedad que se hace con militares que disponen de un ceremonial propio.
Uso en el extranjero
En el extranjero, las embajadas, consulados y legaciones oficiales de la Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores son las encargadas de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley y el respeto al himno nacional, evitando su uso comercial y autorizando su interpretación previa consulta con la Secretaría de Gobernación en situaciones que no sean actos cívicos, además de promover su interpretación en actos públicos solemnes realizados por mexicanos. Además tiene la obligación de solicitar ante el gobierno que está acreditado que prohíba su uso, sobre todo si es de carácter comercial.
En otros idiomas
En México hay personas que conservan y hablan exclusivamente lenguas indígenas o propias de su cultura de origen, desde el 8 de diciembre de 2005, el artículo 39 de la ley permite la traducción de la letra a las lenguas nativas. La traducción debe ser sancionada por el Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas y autorizada por la Secretaría de Gobernación.
Hasta 2014, el himno nacional ha sido traducido a las siguientes lenguas indígenas: chinanteco, otomí, mixteco, maya, náhuatl y huasteco. Otros grupos nativos han traducido el himno a sus respectivas lenguas, pero no ha sido sancionado por el gobierno.
Fuera de las lenguas nativas, ha sido traducido al bajo alemán (Plautdietsch). Niños y jóvenes menonitas de México entonan el himno nacional mexicano traducido al alemán dentro de sus colegios cada lunes. En 2008 resultó ganador a nivel estatal un colegio menonita llamado La Esperanza del municipio chihuahuense de Cuauhtémoc, quienes entonaron el himno nacional mexicano en español y una estrofa en su idioma materno.
Enseñanza y difusión
Desde 2005 es una obligación la enseñanza del Himno Nacional en todos los planteles de educación prescolar, primaria y secundaria en el país. Para lograr eso, desde ese año se organiza un Concurso Nacional de Interpretación del Himno por Coros Infantiles.
Vigilancia
En México la Secretaría de Gobernación es la encargada de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley, aunque se puede ayudar de las demás oficinas del gobierno federal. Como el caso de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores para otras naciones o la Secretaría de Educación Pública para el caso de la difusión y enseñanza.
Importancia cultural
Aficionados mexicanos interpretando el himno nacional antes de un partido de fútbol.
Tras la escritura del himno, México seguía enfrentándose a los efectos de una derrota en una guerra con Estados Unidos. El país se sentía desmoralizado y también dividido, debido a la pérdida de aproximadamente la mitad de su territorio, el cual le pertenecía ya a Estados Unidos. De acuerdo con el historiador Javier Garciadiego, quien habló en una ceremonia conmemorativa del 150.º aniversario de la aprobación del himno en 2004, el himno hace caso omiso a las divisiones y conflictos y anima la unidad nacional. En esa misma fecha, la Ciudad de México y otras partes del país detuvieron lo que hacían e interpretaron un canto del himno a nivel nacional. Individuos de otras naciones participaron también, mayoritariamente en las oficinas diplomáticas o en lugares donde se encontraban una alta concentración de expatriados de México. El himno también ha sido descrito como uno de los símbolos de la «identidad mexicana».
Antes de 1820
Entre los pueblos prehispánicos no se tiene noticia de que existiera al menos algo parecido a un himno que se identificara unívocamente a algunos de los altépetl, pero al llegar las tradiciones europeas tras la llamada Conquista Española, florecieron los llamados himnos religiosos en cuyas letras y música alababan la vida de algún Santo o la deidad de la Iglesia Católica, así como los himnos cívicos que trataban de alabar la llegada de virreyes, de obispos, clérigos, la entronización de reyes españoles y más comúnmente la vida de algún personaje o grupo novohispano, de entre los autores más destacados de ese tipo de himnos tenemos a Manuel de Sumaya, José de Torres y José Aldana, cuya obra religiosa fue profusamente elogiadas en su tiempo y aún hoy, destacan de toda su obra los himnos dedicados a la Virgen de Guadalupe. La primera vez que existió en México algo muy parecido a un Himno Nacional fue la llamada Marcha Real o Marcha Granadera que desde 1761 se empezó a usar en España y sus colonias durante las ceremonias cívicas, autoría de Manuel de Espinosa de los Monteros, fue una obra de cierto agrado que influyo en los años posteriores en el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano que se formó durante la Guerra de Independencia
Siglo xix
Al consumarse la independencia de México en 1821, el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano solo impulsó la creación de un escudo y bandera nacional como símbolo del nuevo estado. Al parecer la idea de un Himno Nacional no era una necesidad por eso durante la entronización de Agustín de Iturbide se cantó el himno religioso Veni Creator en forma especial. Posteriormente el protocolo de toma del cargo para el primer presidente y vicepresidente de México no incluyó ningún himno o canción usada como un himno.
A pesar de eso, durante ese primer medio siglo, nunca faltaron propuestas informales de himnos que trataron de tomar el lugar. Por ejemplo, durante la etapa final de la Guerra de Independencia se realizó un sitio a la ciudad de Querétaro por parte de tropas Trigarantes, entre esas tropas se encontraba un músico llamado José Torrescano quien compuso un himno muy anti español, cuya frase más cuestionada era:
Somos independientes,/viva la Libertad,/viva América libre/y viva la igualdad.
Por eso no fue muy promovido el himno, ya que la idea del Ejército Trigarante era lograr la unidad de todos los grupos sociales de la Nueva España.
Ya en lo que se considera el México independiente, en 1822, otro músico de nombre José María Garmendía realizó otro himno que no gustó por estar muy centrado en la figura de Agustín de Iturbide. Por ejemplo, sus primeras palabras eran:
A las armas, valientes indianos;/a las armas corred con valor;/el partido seguid de Iturbide;/seamos libres y no haya opresión.
Por eso al cambiar de régimen monárquico a republicano este fue totalmente olvidado.
Luego, durante las república tanto federalista como centralista, cuando se querían hacer honores al presidente o vicepresidente se interpretaba alguna pieza de su agrado. Por ejemplo Antonio López de Santa Anna gustaba de la obertura Semiramis de Gioachino Rossini, mientras José Joaquín de Herrera prefería Poeta y campesino de Franz von Suppé.
El 13 de julio de 1844 otro músico de nombre musicalizó un poema anónimo que honraba a Antonio López de Santa Anna quien estaba en su 8º periodo de gobierno durante la república centralista, este no gustó al público y terminó olvidado.
En 1849 luego de la desastrosa Guerra Mexicana-Estadounidense de 1846 a 1848 y durante la presidencia federal de José Joaquín de Herrera se formó una llamada Junta Patriótica de la Ciudad de México que, a través de la Academia de San Juan de Letrán, organizó un concurso para buscar una letra que junto a la música del pianista austriaco Henri Herz, pudiera formar un himno nacional. Ese primer concurso fue la propuesta más seria hasta el momento, incluía entre sus jueces a personajes muy destacados de la época, como Andrés Quintana Roo, Manuel Lacunza, José Joaquín Pesado, Manuel Carpio y Alejandro Arango y Escandón. El concurso fue ganado por el estadounidense Andrés David Bradburn, lo cual junto con el contenido de la obra hizo que fuera un verdadero fracaso que terminó por olvidarse.
Poco después, en 1850, la misma Academia de San Juan de Letrán realizó su propio concurso para musicalizar un poema del cubano Juan Miguel Lozada, la música seleccionada fue obra de Nicolás-Charles Bochsa, pero al ser un poema muy centrado en la figura del presidente José Joaquín de Herrera no trascendió.
Al parecer durante ese año se dio una especie de competencia informal ya que el músico italiano Antonio Barilli propuso no solo un himno, propuso dos, los cuales de ninguna manera fueron del agrado del pueblo mexicano. Poco después, en 1851, otro músico de origen checo Max Maretzek presentó su propuesta y no fructificó, y así se fueron acumulando en tan solo tres años varios intentos. En abril de 1853, el italiano Inocencio Pellegrini, presentó su “Canto Nacional” sin mucho éxito, si es que tuvo alguno. En diciembre de 1853, otro músico de apellido Infante creó una composición patriótica dedicada a Antonio López de Santa Anna la cual solo se tocó una noche.
Otras personalidades que presentaron propuestas formales e informales fueron, Fernando Calderón y Beltrán, José María Garmendia, Francisco Manuel Sánchez de Tagle, Mariano Elízaga y José María Heredia
Competencia oficial
No se sabe si debido a esa efervescencia o solo por el gusto del entonces presidente y dictador Antonio López de Santa Anna el 12 de noviembre de 1853 por medio del Diario Oficial del gobierno de la República Mexicana se dio a conocer un doble concurso, cuyo fin y orden seria seleccionar un poema patriótico y su musicalización posterior para formar un Himno a la Patria. 
En 1854 se celebraría el 25 Aniversario de "La Victoria de Tampico de 1829" cuando Antonio López de Santa Anna venció al Ejército Español en su intento de reconquista. Buscó Santa Anna festejar por todo lo alto su gran victoria militar donde alcanzó el rango de General de División. El concurso se convocó con la anticipación debida para que el 11 de septiembre del siguiente año se tuviera el Himno Nacional arreglado.
Para la letra se solicitaba enviar la propuesta en sobre cerrado con un seudónimo al Ministerio de Fomento, Colonización, Industria y Comercio en menos de veinte días, tras lo cual se tardarían diez días para definir al ganador, luego de darse a conocer al ganador, la musicalización tendría otro mes para recibir propuestas, tras lo cual se tardaría un mes más para dar a conocer al ganador de la música. En la misma convocatoria se definía que los derechos de explotación de las propuestas pasarían a manos del gobierno central y solo se entregaría una contraprestación a los ganadores. Esta convocatoria fue firmada por el entonces oficial mayor del ministerio Miguel Lerdo de Tejada, el jurado para la letra estuvo formado por José Bernardo Couto, Manuel Carpio y José Joaquín Pesado, mientras el jurado para la música se integró por José Antonio Gómez, Agustín Balderas y Tomás León.
El resultado para la letra se publicó el 4 de febrero de 1854 en el diario oficial junto a la letra, siendo ganador el potosino Francisco González Bocanegra, quien luego se supiera realizó la letra encerrado en una habitación por la que era entonces su prometida, Guadalupe González del Pino, ya que él no quería participar en el concurso. González fue anunciado el ganador en el Diario Oficial del gobierno de la República Mexicana del 3 de febrero de 1854.
Si bien el himno de González Bocanegra es un himno de corte bélico, no lo es de ataque, agresión ó expansionismo sino todo lo contrario, es un himno de defensa de la patria y del territorio nacional. Seguramente inspirado en el evento militar que se recordaba y festejaba ese año de 1854 al cumplirse 25 años de la Invasión Española de Reconquista, el poeta narra en sus estrofas la situación y disposición de los mexicanos y la nación ante una invasión extranjera, no así para una guerra intestina y fratricida. Santa Anna, el gran "Vencedor de Tampico" sería recordado en ese himno santanista que incluso le fue obsequiado por González Bocanegra en la dedicatoria la misma noche de su estreno en el Gran Teatro de Santa Anna. El himno reseña una gran victoria militar contra un "extraño enemigo" es decir una nación extranjera. La única gran victoria con esas características que se celebraba en México en esa época era la obtenida en Tampico en 1829. 
Como decía la convocatoria, tras darse a conocer al ganador de la letra se abrió el concurso de la música, se realizó como se decía en un mes, siendo ganadora la obra del músico italiano Giovanni Bottesini, pero simplemente no gusto, además fue acusado de musicalizar y dar a conocer por fuera del concurso su propuesta, lo cual era contrario a los términos del concurso. Debido a eso, el concurso se prolongó hasta los ciento ochenta días, mientras el 18 de mayo de 1854 estreno formalmente su propuesta en el Teatro Santa Anna con las voces de la soprano Enriqueta Sontag y el tenor Gaspar Pozzolini, pero aun así no fue del agrado del público en general.
Tras esa prolongación a ciento ochenta días, fue la propuesta del músico español Jaime Nunó Roca la que ganó. Por entonces Nunó era director de las bandas militares del ejército nacional, ese puesto lo había logrado por invitación de Antonio López de Santa Anna quien lo había conocido en uno de sus varios exilios en Cuba. Su obra con el seudónimo Dios y Libertad, fue declarada ganadora el 12 de agosto de 1854 por medio del Diario Oficial del gobierno de la República Mexicana. El himno fue aceptado el día de la independencia del mismo año. La interpretación inaugural fue dirigida por Giovanni Bottesini, cantado por Claudia Florenti y Lorenzo Salvi, en el Teatro Santa Anna.
Poco más de un mes después, la noche del 15 de septiembre de 1854, fue interpretado públicamente por primera vez el himno, en el entonces famoso Teatro Santa Anna, que por entonces cerraba al poniente la calle que hoy se llama 5 de Mayo en el hoy llamado Centro Histórico de la ciudad de México que en aquella época era lo único que se llamaba ciudad de México. Luego de algunas palabras del poeta Francisco González Bocanegra se interpretó el himno, dirigido por Giovanni Bottesini y las voces de Claudina Florentini, Lorenzo Salvi y coros del teatro a cargo de René Masón y Pedro Carvajal, esa primera vez no fue el estreno oficial ya que solo hasta el día siguiente fue cuando Antonio López de Santa Anna en su carácter de presidente asistió a su interpretación, por parte de Balbina Steffenone y Lorenzo Salvi. Al contrario de todos los intentos anteriores su éxito fue casi inmediato y su partitura se vendió en las calles.
Su rechazo y aceptación
Pero no duro mucho su fortuna, el 9 de agosto de 1855 Antonio López de Santa Anna deja la presidencia por última vez y abandona México, Jaime Nunó le sigue a la Habana y luego se pierde en los EE.UU.; A la vez Francisco González Bocanegra se esconde en casa de un tío para evitar represalias y no vuelve ponerse a descubierto del público, muere de tifo el 11 de abril de 1861 a sus 37 años. La causa de ese repentino cambio es por la llamada Revolución de Ayutla que desde el 1 de marzo de 1854 venia impulsando un cambio de gobierno, federalista y liberal.
Por la Revolución de Ayutla los grupos liberales y federalistas se hacen del poder e inicia la llamada Época de la Reforma, que traería personajes como Benito Juárez, Melchor Ocampo, Ignacio Ramírez, Miguel Lerdo de Tejada, Guillermo Prieto, Juan N. Álvarez e Ignacio Comonfort, como eran contrarios a Santa Anna hicieron lo posible para que se olvidara el himno santanista, si bien no lo prohibieron de ninguna manera alentaron su interpretación pero poco a poco el himno fue ganando adeptos. Por ejemplo, al final de la Guerra de Reforma cuando las tropas federales retomaban la ciudad de México el Gral. Liberal Florencio María del Castillo relata que
La comitiva se detuvo frente al primer arco para escuchar el himno, cuya letra sentimos no haber conseguido. Terminado el himno, fue entonada la Marsellesa, esa marcha que conmueve los corazones de todos los pueblos y la multitud repitió el estribillo.
De lo anterior se puede ampliar que hasta la llamada Segunda Intervención Francesa el himno más popular en México entre los liberales y muchos otros grupos era La Marsellesa, y que aun durante la guerra en el Segundo Imperio Mexicano era el himno preferido por Benito Juárez para ser tocado en su presencia como Presidente de México. Otro himno muy popular, aunque no fue escrito como tal, fue obra de Guillermo Prieto quien la había escrito como poema satírico en 1853, apareció en su libro de 1854 “Viajes de Orden Suprema”, ese poema musicalizado había sido presentado al concurso santanista por Guillermo Prieto a través de un tercero y titulada “La Marcha de los Cangrejos”, obviamente no ganó, pero para 1864 al inicio del Segundo Imperio Mexicano ya era una de las canciones más populares en México, al punto de que el propio Emperador Maximiliano solicitó que se tocara en su presencia durante una visita a la ciudad de Guanajuato en 1864, como una manera de congraciarse con los liberales, pero el efecto fue un severo susto e indignación de los grupos conservadores y monárquicos que lo apoyaron para llegar al trono. De ese himno informal Melchor Ocampo cuenta que
Los cangrejos, convertidos en himno popular, formulaban el regocijo y el orden y la concordia embellecían un día que lo sobreponen en grandeza a la recepción del Ejército Trigarante.(Sic)
Otra obra que llegó a ser muy popular y usada como himno fue “Adiós Mamá Carlota” que solo por su letra no terminó por oficializarse. En todo caso al final de la guerra y con la República Restaurada, el himno santanista volvió a tener presencia, si no es que la tuvo durante toda la guerra, aunque con varias modificaciones, por ejemplo en 1864 el presidente Benito Juárez discutió con varios sobre ciertas modificaciones a la letra, le sugerían suprimir la referencia al “Guerrero inmortal de Zempoala”, a lo que contesto:
Al Himno Nacional no se le quita ni una sola nota, ni una sola palabra.
Otro cambio que sí perduró fue en la séptima estrofa, cambiando, “Si a la lid contra Estado enemigo” por “Si a la lid contra hueste enemiga”, además de muchas otras que no perduraron.
Tras esa época llegó la presidencia de Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada hermano de quien siendo oficial mayor firmó la convocatoria al concurso de 1853, al parecer desde ese momento se impulsó el uso del himno santanista aunque con modificaciones. Tras la caída de su gobierno por el Plan de Tuxtepec, el nuevo presidente Porfirio Díaz empezó a usar el himno santanista de común para las ceremonias oficiales.
Siglo xx
En 1901 es redescubierto, por decirlo de alguna manera, el compositor Jaime Nunó. Un grupo de mexicanos que estaban de viaje por Estados Unidos lo encuentra en la ciudad de Buffalo, Nueva York, lo dan a conocer al presidente y este lo invita a visitar México, acepta y durante su visita por primera vez dirige orquesta y coros para interpretar el Himno Mexicano, pero su visita no resulta cálida y regresa a Nueva York. Para entonces era ciudadano estadounidense. En 1904 vuelve a ser invitado con motivo de los cincuenta años del Himno, con mucho más éxito que la visita anterior, esa fue la última vez que, vivo, tocó suelo mexicano, ya que muere el 18 de julio de 1908 en Bay City, Nueva Jersey. Durante su primera visita el 11 de febrero de 1901 tras una sesión solemne se anunció que el Congreso de la Unión concedía a Jaime Nunó y González Bocanegra la cantidad de dos mil pesos de entonces como contraprestación y premio por el concurso de 1853. Por parte de González Bocanegra, el dinero fue recibido por Mercedes Serralde de González Bocanegra como heredera del poeta, además a Nunó se le dieron los 388 pesos que puso de su bolsillo para hacer la primera tirada de la partitura en 1854, lo cual él ratificó en una entrevista al diario El Imparcial del 9 de julio de 1901.
Durante las celebraciones del Centenario de la Independencia se vuelve normal el uso del himno santanista y se le empieza a llamar corrientemente como “Himno Nacional Méxicano”. Durante la Revolución Mexicana ya tiene el sello de aprobación popular y oficial, pero sin una reglamentación clara, se interpreta con las estrofas a gusto del intérprete, aunque algunas ya se destacan entre las diez, cuatro de ellas en concreto. Para la llamada Guerra Cristera incluso se usa por parte del gobierno anticlerical la segunda estrofa que dice:
“…/de la paz el arcángel divino/'que en el cielo tu eterno destino/por el dedo de Dios se escribió/...
La primera vez que se grabó el Himno en un medio sonoro fue el 28 de julio de 1922 por la cantante duranguense Fanny Anitúa. Su versión, al decir de muchos, fue deficiente y modificada, lo que causó gran polémica al grado de requerir una revisión oficial, por parte del Consejo Cultural del Distrito Federal. La revisión fue llevada a cabo por José López Portillo y Rojas, Manuel Barajas y Julián Carrillo. Durante esta revisión se conoció la pérdida de los textos originales, entonces el grupo recurrió a la familia de González Bocanegra, quienes entregaron originales del estribillo y las estrofas, también se consiguió una primera edición del Himno bajo el sello de la Casa Murguía en 1854. Por otra parte, una de las familias pudientes de la época, identificada como Pérez Salas, obsequió una instrumentación del Himno que el mismo Jaime Nunó envió a la plana mayor del Ejército Nacional y a la Dirección General de Artillería, uno de los que pagó con 388 pesos.
Esa revisión demostró los varios cambios que había sufrido el Himno, así como la dificultad de interpretarlo completo, por eso se empezó a limitar el número de estrofas, pero sin seguir una formalidad. Por eso el 4 de mayo de 1943, el entonces Presidente de México, Manuel Ávila Camacho, durante la participación de México en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, promulgó un Decreto que oficializaba el Himno y lo limitaba a las estrofas I, V, VI y X, más el estribillo. Por ese decreto se prohibió alterar, corregir o modificar la letra o la música. Ese decreto se formalizó aún más y conjugó con los otros símbolos patrios el 23 de diciembre de 1967 por la Ley sobre las características y el uso del Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales, ley que fue suprimida en 1984 por la Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales, la cual es el ordenamiento que la rige hasta hoy.
Controversias
Derechos de autor
En 1959 la Sociedad Repertorio Wagner, S. A., publicó una partitura para que se pudiera interpretar el Himno Nacional Mexicano por parte de las bandas civiles de música, el decreto de 1943 no tenía una partitura anexa y debía conseguirse aparte, además de que no era fácil duplicar el decreto, esa publicación levantó varios gritos de histeria y terror entre el pueblo mexicano, ya que varios periódicos difundieron la supuesta noticia de que Wagner era propietaria o se hacía pasar por propietaria del himno nacional. Debido a eso, por ejemplo, se dijo que cada lunes los estudiantes debían dar un peso a su escuela para poder interpretar el himno. Lo que a todas luces es falso.
De esta manera durante toda su vida el himno ha estado, por decirlo ligeramente, lleno de bromas de mal gusto, incluso en la era del internet, como ejemplo de ello está el rumor de que la Casa Wagner y Levien registró el Himno Nacional Mexicano y que por eso cobraba los derechos de ejecución, declarándose propietaria de la obra a nivel internacional, situación similar pasa en los EE.UU. con la casa Ralph S. Perr y Compañía.
Pero por más desmentido oficial que hace el gobierno mexicano, aún sigue el mito. En septiembre de 1959 luego de poner una multa a la Casa Wagner, se realizó una investigación para dilucidar si el rumor de que la familia de Jaime Nunó había vendido los derechos del autor a una casa musical en los EE.UU. de la investigación se determinó que no existió tal venta de sus derechos de explotación y menos sus derechos de autor, aunque luego se encontró que el mismo Jaime Nunó había vendido en la década de 1850 sus derechos de explotación efectivamente a una casa de música estadounidense pero solo de un arreglo a la música del himno, un arreglo para tocar el himno al piano, ese arreglo además estaba en otro ritmo y tenor por lo que era muy diferente a la versión original. Además, para 1960, ya habían pasado los cien años que protegía la legislación estadounidense los derechos de explotación y por la misma legislación al ser una obra anterior a 1909 no le aplicaba la ley vigente en 1953, antes de 1909 no existía ley en EE.UU. que protegiera eso, en último caso no transcendía su ley fuera de sus fronteras.
Otra versión de la venta de los derechos de Jaime Nunó es como sigue, el propio Nunó y dos estadounidenses, Harry Henneman y Phil Hill registraron la música de Nuñó con la empresa BMI, Edward B. Marks Music Company fue entonces la editora del himno en los EE.UU. en 1910 y 1911. Por lo que luego de encontrarse con las publicaciones de esa casa editorial varios mexicanos empezaron a propagar el rumor sobre que esa casa comercial era la dueña de los derechos de autor. No obstante, la ley de los derechos de autor en Estados Unidos declara que el himno mexicano está en el dominio público dentro de los Estados Unidos, dado que tanto la letra como la música fueron estrenadas antes de 1909. Además, bajo la ley de derechos de autor en México, el artículo 155 expone que el gobierno tiene los derechos morales, pero no el derecho de autor, del himno; además de que también en México está en dominio público ya que se cumplieron los cien años establecidos para su liberación desde el 2008.
Himno bélico
Otra polémica muy habitual se basa en que la letra del himno es muy bélica, por ejemplo se dice que el estribillo llama a la guerra “Mexicanos al grito de guerra”, por lo que varias veces se ha propuesto modificar o cambiar de plano el himno, incluso en tiempos recientes el poeta Javier Sicilia en una entrevista sobre la Caravana con Justicia y Dignidad a la pregunta de
También lo preguntaba por el lábaro patrio, porque he visto que te molesta el belicismo del Himno Nacional de México… Respondió Sicilia.
Cuando han intentado cantar el Himno en el templete de las caravanas yo digo: no, habría que cambiarlo, si lo escuchamos –es el problema de no atender a las palabras-, el Himno justifica la guerra, necesitamos cambiar la letra, esa letra no nos representa, fue de un momento histórico y no es el que vivimos, estamos en la búsqueda de la paz, del amor, del reconocimiento de lo humano, por encima de las fronteras y naciones.(Sic)
Esa polémica básicamente se ve en personajes de la izquierda mexicana, como lo es Sicilia.
Es un himno de la derecha
En forma paralela sobre el tema belicista del himno, esta la polémica sobre su origen santanista, ya que Antonio López de Santa Anna es uno, si no, el más odiado personaje de la historia mexicana, sobre todo se recuerda su participación en la Guerra Mexicana-Estadounidense y en la Guerra Texana, los principales defensores de esta polémica están en la llamada Izquierda, mientras los llamados políticos de Derecha normalmente defienden el himno como una obra propia de su tiempo que ha ganado su lugar en la historia y estima del pueblo. Como refuerzo del rechazo al himno se marca su estilo musical conocido como Quinta Real por su parecido con la Marcha Real, una marcha militar que desde 1791 se usa como himno de España.
Cine
En 1943, cuando se oficializó el himno, se estrenó la película Mexicanos al grito de guerra, dirigida por Álvaro Gálvez y Fuentes e Ismael Rodríguez y protagonizada por Pedro Infante y Lina Montes, cuya trama básica es la supuesta historia del Himno Nacional hasta la Batalla del 5 de mayo en Puebla. En la parte final se muestra a los soldados mexicanos cantando el himno para darse valor, pero ningún documento histórico ha podido respaldar esa escena.
El segundo
Durante décadas se ha dicho, e incluso medios de comunicación han informado, que el Himno Nacional Mexicano es considerado el segundo más bello del mundo, detrás de La Marsellesa pero hasta el día de hoy, no se ha llevado a cabo ningún tipo de concurso o competición arbitrada que avale ese dicho. Incluso es común oír este mito aplicado a otros Himnos Nacionales, como por ejemplo el ecuatoriano, colombiano, peruano, inglés, estadounidense, etc.
Versión original
Versión original y completa del himno como se conoció en 1853.
(Estribillo)
Mexicanos, al grito de guerra
El acero aprestad y el bridón;
Y retiemble en sus centros la tierra
Al sonoro rugir del cañón.
I
Ciña ¡Oh Patria! tus sienes de oliva
de la paz el arcángel divino,
que en el cielo tu eterno destino
por el dedo de Dios se escribió.
Mas si osare un extraño enemigo
profanar con su planta tu suelo,
piensa ¡Oh Patria querida! que el cielo
un soldado en cada hijo te dio.
II
En sangrientos combates los viste
por tu amor palpitando sus senos,
arrostrar la metralla serenos,
y la muerte o la gloria buscar.
Si el recuerdo de antiguas hazañas
de tus hijos inflama la mente,
los recuerdos del triunfo tu frente,
volverán inmortales a ornar.
III
Como al golpe del rayo la encina,
se derrumba hasta el hondo torrente,
la discordia vencida, impotente,
a los pies del arcángel cayó.
Ya no más, de tus hijos la sangre,
se derrame en contienda de hermanos;
sólo encuentre el acero en sus manos
quien tu nombre sagrado insultó.
IV
Del guerrero inmortal de Zempoala
te defiende la espada terrible,
y sostiene su brazo invencible,
tu sagrado pendón tricolor.
Él será del feliz mexicano
en la paz y en la guerra el caudillo.
porque él supo sus armas de brillo
circundar en los campos de honor.
V
¡Guerra, guerra sin tregua al que intente
de la patria manchar los blasones!
¡guerra, guerra! los patrios pendones
en las olas de sangre empapad.
¡Guerra, guerra! en el monte, en el valle,
los cañones horrísonos truenen
y los ecos sonoros resuenen
con las voces de ¡Unión! ¡Libertad!.
VI
Antes, Patria, que inermes tus hijos
bajo el yugo su cuello dobleguen,
tus campiñas con sangre se rieguen,
sobre sangre se estampe su pie.
Y tus templos, palacios y torres
se derrumben con hórrido estruendo,
y sus ruinas existan diciendo:
de mil héroes la patria aquí fue.
VII
Si a la lid contra hueste enemiga,
nos convoca la trompa guerrera,
de Iturbide la sacra bandera,
mexicanos, valientes seguid.
Y a los fieles bridones les sirvan
las vencidas enseñas de alfombra;
los laureles del triunfo den sombra
a la frente del Bravo Adalid.
VIII
Vuelva altivo a los patrios hogares,
el guerrero a cantar su victoria,
ostentando las palmas de gloria
que supiera en la lid conquistar.
Tornaránse sus lauros sangrientos
en guirnaldas de mirtos y rosas,
que el amor de las hijas y esposas,
también sabe a los bravos premiar.
IX
Y el que al golpe de ardiente metralla,
de la Patria en las aras sucumba,
obtendrá en recompensa una tumba
donde brille, de gloria, la luz.
Y, de Iguala, la enseña querida
a su espada sangrienta enlazada,
de laurel inmortal coronada,
formará de su fosa una cruz.
X
¡Patria! ¡Patria! tus hijos te juran
exhalar en tus aras su aliento,
si el clarín con su bélico acento
los convoca a lidiar con valor.
¡Para ti las guirnaldas de oliva!
¡un recuerdo para ellos de gloria!
¡un laurel para ti de victoria!
¡un sepulcro para ellos de honor!.

I was a bad reputation
With an attitude to match
Hellbent on goin' nowhere
And gettin' there lightnin' fast
Twenty-one and lookin' thirty
But actin' half my age
Bound to hit a wall
Before I ever hit the brakes

Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought somethin' like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dyin' man
When a Friday meets a Sunday
You can't help but see the light
I never believed in angels
'Til one believed in me that night
Turned my off-track into a straight line
Before I turned into a headline

Like, Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought somethin' like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dyin' man

Woah-oh
Turned a one-way man one-eighty
Settled down a given-upper
Yeah, you changed a "You can't change me"
So, the world won't see another

Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought somethin' like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dyin' man

Yeah, I'm always down for two beers
That ain't nothin' new here
It's usually what I do here, but not tonight
Yeah, we had a bad one
Way worse than the last one
Ain't no comin' back from this goodbye

Looks like I did it again, me and my stupid mouth
I dug myself into a hole in a wall and I gotta drink my way out
Bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice, yeah
I need a corner with the lights turned down
I can't take a good time cold beer crowd
It's just me, Jack and Jim
Won't you play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey friends?
Me and my whiskey friends

And we just need a slow song, tryna let her go song
Throw a little Jones on
Leave us alone 'til she's long gone
Got a lot of over-her work left to do that we need to get into

Bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice, yeah

Tell 'em to shoot

You got a new bitch, what the fuck you cryin' for?
I'm movin' selfish, callin' all my favorite hoes
You know how to reach me every time and it plays in your mind
With a rush that feels like we committed a crime
Know where you belong, I'm gon' save you a spot
But can't be outside 'cause the block is too hot
And I'm all on your mind
Wherever you are, don't call me (Let's go)

Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin' (Alright)

Strange light revolves around you
You float across the room
Your touch is made of something
Heaven can't hold a candle to
You're made of something new
Let's not get complicated
Let's just enjoy the view
It's hard to be a human
So much to put an answer to
But that's just what we do
God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

I'm having revelations
You dance across the floor
Beyond infatuation
How I obsessively adore you
That's what I do

I believe, I believe
I could die in your kiss
No, it doesn't get, doesn't get
Better than this

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control

Y por todo el bulevar
Con mi compa Flaco arremangando
Unos huaraches, mi gorra de lado
Por la Zapata, el Gordo trae el mando
Tirando linea con Manny y el Caña
A la orden pa'l desorden conectado
Y mi RT en Acapulco
Y si hay pedo, los sepulto
Aquí no andamos haciendo bulto
Al chingazo yo resulto
Y una glockzona que va conmigo
Siempre lista para un susto
Y que sigan llegando las pacas
Su compa Chinito
Puro Apaseo el Alto

Y mi compa Mario que nunca me deja
Unas banquetearas a veces tomando
Y mi compa Power y también el Mau
Me hacen segunda, nunca me han dejado
Y mi compa Sapo, si hay pedo, él brinca
A la orden en una a tirar vergazos
Y acá la envidia al chile que no existe
Y pa' qué les cuento si no tiene chiste
Yo soy el Gordo, para que se ubiquen
Y en una moto yo les caigo en 15

There's a bottle on the King James coaster
Miller Lite full of cigarettes
Too drunk to be hungover
Last night still on my breath
There ain't no startin' over
And this over never ends

I thought by now I'd have it figured out
How not to make the easy thing so hard to do
I bet that I'd be further down this road
If I could read the signs that point me to the truth

I never planned on being nothin' but a cowboy
But somewhere I picked up this old guitar
Girl, all I can say is that I'm sorry
If I get kinda careless with your heart
All the headlights, all the midnights
Chasin' all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy and the gypsy
I guess all I'm sayin' is forgive me
If I don't know what I'm doin'
I'm still learnin' to be human

So far I've been good at burnin' bridges
Strike a match and ride right out of town
Bless your heart for nevеr tryin' to fix me
Or quit me or slow me down

Chasin' all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy and the gypsy

If I don't know what I'm doin'

Rollin' outta nowhere with the brakes off
All the crazy and the whiskey

Granddaddy drank Heavy, and daddy drank Light
I can turn any day to Saturday night, if I want to
And most the time I want to
I can still paint a picture of a hemlock view
My mountains had smoke, but the ones that were blue that we'd buy then
Were the ones I spent a little more time in
Between the hangovers and the handcuffs
It’s been a minute since I had one in my hand, 'cause

Everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I’m livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriеty
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I’m just sayin’ I'm doin’ thе best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand
When I was puttin' 'em down, they put me through hell
Put some scars on some trucks, myself as well
But if I never did put that can to my mouth
I wouldn't have nothin’ I could sing about

Yeah, everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I'm livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriety
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind

Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

I'm so mature, I'm so mature

I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playin' on my patience
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi

Yeah, I've been throwin' down the whiskey
I ought to get my money back
Someone said it drowns the memory
Aw, but it ain't doin' Jack
Yeah, I've been sippin', I've been buzzin'
Shootin' doubles like it's nothin'
Aw, but nothin' makes you go away

I need something "You proof"
Something stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pourin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothing's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
Yeah, I need something "You proof"
Aw, I need something "You proof"
Poured 'em up 'til they're shutting 'em down, yeah
You never ain't not around, yeah
Don't matter what time or town, I can't get you gone
Turned the bar, yeah, upside down
Just lookin' for somethin' that does it
I'd give up all my money

Ain't nobody sellin' nothin' "You proof"
Something stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pourin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothing's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
Yeah, I need something "You proof"
Aw, I need something "You proof"

Hey, I've been mixin' liquors tryin' to get you gone
Aw, but I must be doing somethin' wrong
'Cause I've been working hard to fade your memory
Baby, but the only thing faded is me

I need something "You proof"
Something stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pourin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothing's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth

Don't know where you at, don't know where you've been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie

When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't

When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

If you want me to quit you, want me to get you

About a thousand memories I gotta forgеt
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all thе help I can get

If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey, some Grizzly

Yahritza Y Su Esencia – No Se Puede Decir AdiósEmbedTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsРусскийTürkçeRich Flex Lyrics

Go buy a zip of weed, hit the club
Pay for 'bout ten niggas to get in
We crunk, lit, in this bitch, yeah
Know we walk around the world
Steppin', not givin a damn 'bout where our feet land at, yeah
Get your ass mushed, smooshed (6ix)
Yeah, 21, the biggest
Put a nigga in the chicken wing, pussy
21, can you do somethin' for me? (21)
Can you hit a lil' rich flex for me? (21)
And 21, can you do somethin' for me? (21, 21)
Drop some bars to my pussy ex for me
Then 21 (21), can you do somethin' for me? (Yeah)
Can you talk to the opps necks for me? (Okay)
21, do your thing 21, do your thing (21)
Do your thing, 21, do your thing

Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21, 21)
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your ho a flea (Fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)
Paid like an athlete, I got—
You might also like
All you hoes, all of you hoes need to remember who y'all talkin' to
It's a Slaughter Gang CEO
I got dick for you if I'm not workin', girl
If I'm busy then fuck no
You need to find you someone else to call
When your bank account get low, you need to find you someone—


Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm on that Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit, ayy

Sticks and stones, chrome on chrome
That's just what a nigga on
Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Nan' nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing BNE
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then its BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy
Ah, what, what
Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
On God
Boy, look, you the motherfuckin' man, boy, you, ooh
You is the man, you hear me?28EmbedFebruary 2023 Singles Release Calendar Lyrics2/1

हाँ, मेरा पाने का समय
मैं भूल भुलैया में खो गया

Some things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie them up and leave 'em
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go

Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field home run ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone
I can say it wasn't meant to be
But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting go
Change the way the river flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind

Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone


She ain't got one bit of stick around
There's no sense in tryin' to slow her down

Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone

It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I gotta hankerin' for four wide tires

Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beatin'
A little bit of love is all that it's needin'
But it's good as it is tough

Everybody's asking what the hell happened
Wondering why it all went wrong
Mama always said if you can't say something nice
Then don't say anything at all
I've got my side of the story and he's got his side, too
And I ain't gonna go and tell you what he did
But I'll tell you what he didn't do

Treat me right, put me first, be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
And always fight for my love, hold on tight like it's something
That he couldn't stand to lose
The devil's in the details
I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the еnd, it wasn't what he did, no
It was what he didn't do
I'm already halfway ovеr him and I ain't taking time to turn around
And I'ma take the high road, even though we both know
I could run him out of this town
That's just dirty laundry, I don't need to wear the truth
So I ain't gonna tell you everything he did
But I'll tell you what he didn't do

Bloody

Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see (See)
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary

He can't rewrite the aggro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountaintops in Paris, cold

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance

Liberdade e amor28EmbedTranslationsFrançaisEspañolPortuguês​golden hour Lyrics
It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, "Where you at tonight?"
Got no alibi

I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Workin' my way through a middle of June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was somethin' in the headlights
That stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death
So I said, "Climb in," and in she climbed
Oh, yeah
Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through еnough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
"Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck"

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reachin' for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smokin' one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come

It's been sixty months and she still comes
To see me from time to time
It was worth the price to see a brighter side
Of the girl I picked up that night
And I might be here forever
It ain't paradise, that's true
But it's a whole hell of a lot better
Than the place I sent him to

Get to do something I love
And I make it home every evening
To an angel God sent from above
Got an eight point on camera from last year
That this season looks like a ten
I got a barn with a fridge full of cold beer
On the weekend it's full of good friends

I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?
I got a half ton that's parked in the driveway
My dog wags his tail when he hears
I grew up in a good place to be from
My folks still got a bunch of good years

Now I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am

To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back

One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man

She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust

Got me over my first wife

God made the world in seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely

Have an angel to hold in my arms"
So God made a girl, His best work of art

You swear that you're stayin' single, next thing you know
You meet a girl at a bar and next thing you know
You get her laughin', it's 2 a.m
You're tellin' your buddies, three months in
Then she ain't movin' in, the next thing you know
There's a U-Haul trailer, the next thing you know
Your old apartment, is y'all's new place
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays

Next thing you know
You're savin' money like never before, just to
Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on onе knee on her mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, "No"
Next thing you know
Your bеst man gives a half-drunk speech and you're
Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your
Left hand's gettin' used to that ring
And there the next two or three years go
Next thing you know
You weren't really tryin', next thing you know
There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death

'Cause next thing you know
You're wearin' scrubs and a funny white hat and the
Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and
Nobody's ever called you that
And you take that drive home slow
Next thing you know
It's first steps, first dates, first car
It's 11:01 wonderin' where they are
You're sayin' that USC's too far
It's amazing how fast seventeen years go
Next thing you know

Next thing you know
You get to know your wife again and you're
More in love than you've ever been
With a lot of years of remember when's and still some down the road

Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before
Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

But it's not real
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before

She never wanted to be white-picket fenced in
Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun
But here she is, free, lyin' next to me
'Cause I ain't tryna tame her love

I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't livin' for a diamond ring
Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out loud
We're burnin' it down
Blazin' up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
Yeah, that's where she calls home

Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn

I remember sittin' at that house, livin' room couch
Thinkin' no way them boys wouldn't win
Between them big three pitchers, Andruw and Chipper
It was gonna be hard to keep up with the Jones's
But as fate would have it, that Atlanta magic
Got put out by them damn Padres
I guess destiny ain't always meant to be
Kinda like you and me that day

We got close, but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run, to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences and came up short
Yeah, you win some, you lose some, it ain't always home runs
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
Had that whole town believin'
Damn, girl, I even had that talk to your dad, man to man
But just like that season
Girl, you and me didn't end with a ring on a hand

We got close, but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run, to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences, and came up short
Yeah, you win some, you lose some, it ain't always home runs
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves

आज सुबह उठा किसी वीडियो में
कुछ के बारे में बात करना जो मैंने एक वीडियो में पोस्ट किया है
अगर मैं ना होता तो क्या तुम्हे भी बुरा लगता
या सिर्फ इसलिए कि मैं काला और भारी हूँ? हालांकि आप सभी मुझे नहीं सुनते

मुझे पता है कि किसी को भी फोन करें और वे आपको बताएंगे कि] (25847163)
प्रसिद्ध, सुंदर, नया, लेकिन मुझे लोगों को जज करने की आदत हो गई है
इसलिए मैं जिस तरह से चलता हूं, उसी तरह चलता हूं और मुझे मुझसे इतना प्यार क्यों है
मुझे अकेलापन महसूस करने की आदत है, ओह
तो, मैंने सोचा कि मैं आपको बता दूं

अगर आज आपको किसी ने नहीं बताया, तो आप खास हैं (विशेष)
यदि किसी ने आपको विश्वास नहीं दिलाया, तो आप विशेष (विशेष) हैं
खैर, मैं हमेशा तुमसे यही कहूंगा, तुम खास हो

और आप किसी लड़की को रद्द कर सकते हैं क्योंकि वह सिर्फ बदलना चाहती थी

इसलिए हम इतना अकेला महसूस करते हैं, इसलिए हमें बहुत शर्म आती है, हम्म

You can't buy this fineness
Let me see the heat get to you
Let me watch the dressing start to peel
It's a kindness, highness
Crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal

Honey, I'm makin' sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie if there's somethin' still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come

Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young

It's quicker and easier to eat your young

Mama, I'm callin', I've got some news
Don't you tell Daddy, he'll blow a fuse
Don't worry, I'm doin' okay
I know you raised me to know right from wrong
It ain't what you think and I'm still writin' songs
Just never thought I'd see the day
I've never felt this way

I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him
Took me to Knoxville last Saturday
And I wore the hat on his dash to the game
It sure wasn't Athens, but I
Fell for him under those Neyland lights

I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

Mama, forgive me, I like him a lot
Hell, I'm learnin' the words to "Old Rocky Top"
He's got a smile that makes me forget
I've always looked better in red

But I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
And I still want the Dawgs to win
But I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

Think I only want one number in my phone

You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-blee"
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me)

I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

I'm talkin' all around the clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts

En jеt particular, me pongo en cualquier lugar
Destapando las champagne, hay billetes pa' gastar
Moviendo bien el ice, everywhere me han de mirar
Con unos tenis Nike, soy maleante y es lo que hay

Cuando por las noches recordaba todo
El olor de aquel perfume sobre todo
Las sábanas blancas donde te escondías dentro
Eres intocable como joya de oro
Esas piernas largas comerme yo solo
Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto
Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejará
Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida, ah, ah
Como tú no hay nadie más
No hay nadie más
Ah
¿Y qué?
Si te sientes sola no me llames porfa
Me pongo sensible, me imagino tu sombra
Clase Azul es el tequila e interior la ropa
Rico Prat champaña, el polvo es color rosa
Me contactó un ángel, eres tú mi hermosa
La que me alegra los días y sigo tomando

Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejarás

I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah

How we get so deep so fast?
Bae, stop playin', I'll beat your ass
You be on some toxic shit but I cannot get off this bitch, I
Haven't seen you in three months, I miss you, can I see you, bae?
Every time I see one of your pictures, that shit drives me crazy
Girl, I know you miss a nigga
Especially how I kiss it
Message say delivered
Why the fuck you keep goin' missing on me?
Every time he get back in the picture, you act different on me
Ayy, tell that nigga we gon' have to share you, I ain't trippin' on it
One more time might be the best for both of us
Maybe we should talk about it later when we sober up
Maybe we should keep it goin', maybe we should let it go
Feel like if it's meant it's what it is so just let it flow
Got somethin' to handle so I'ma be here for a couple hours
Figured out you like them, my assistant keep on sendin' flowers
They got they own business, tell me why the fuck they all in ours?
Mama raised a lot of things but she ain't raised no fuckin' coward
We went to the moon last time, I'm tryna go back
We been doin' our thing for a while but they don't know that
I be buyin' you all type of bags but you can't show that
I be playin' the cut until you come back
I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah

Thinkin' how we played out
Really I feel off about it but ain't never said it
We ain't gotta talk about it
They'll never know when I'm with you, I play a different role
Can't move off emotion, this shit deep now I got self-control
I ain't never tried to hold you, niggas try to high and low me
I can break it down in dumbest terms and show you how you owe me
Still try and back door me, I know how to go about it
I know everything but I treat you like I don't know about it
Wildin' in Skyami, we took shrooms and caught a different vibe
Bitches can't fuck with you, you the one, for real, I peep your style
I gotta get to it, I'm OT so it's gon' be a while
It feel a lil' better when I ain't seen you, yeah

I know you miss me

La letra del himno alude a victorias mexicanas en batallas y trata sobre la defensa de la patria. Sus estrofas y estribillo fueron compuestas por el poeta potosino Francisco González Bocanegra en 1853, mientras que su música, obra del músico español Jaime Nunó, fue compuesta al año siguiente.
En su versión original, el himno está compuesto por diez estrofas, pero en los noventa años que pasó para su oficialización pasó por varias modificaciones o intentos de modificación, quedando reducido solo a cuatro estrofas y el estribillo a partir de 1943, cuando fue oficializado.

Las características y uso del Himno Nacional Mexicano está regulada por la “Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales” en sus artículos 1, 4, Capítulo V de los artículos 38 a 49, y el Capítulo Especial de los artículos 57 a 60. Y se menciona que el texto del himno y partitura de la música se encuentran autentificados por firma de los titulares de los poderes federales, en una copia triple que se deposita para su resguardo en el Archivo General de la Nación, en la Biblioteca Nacional y en el Museo Nacional de Historia.
Letra
La letra oficial del himno mexicano se compone de cuatro estrofas y un estribillo como marca el artículo 57 de la citada ley y esas estrofas y estribillo son:
Coro
Mexicanos, al grito de guerra
El acero aprestad y el bridón;
Y retiemble en sus centros la tierra
Al sonoro rugir del cañón.
Y retiemble en sus centros la tierra
Al sonoro rugir del cañón.
Estrofas
I
Ciña ¡Oh Patria! tus sienes de oliva
de la paz el arcángel divino,
que en el cielo tu eterno destino
por el dedo de Dios se escribió.
Mas si osare un extraño enemigo
profanar con su planta tu suelo,
piensa ¡Oh Patria querida! que el cielo
un soldado en cada hijo te dio.
V
¡Guerra, guerra sin tregua al que intente
de la patria manchar los blasones!,
¡guerra, guerra! los patrios pendones
en las olas de sangre empapad.
¡Guerra, guerra! en el monte, en el valle,
los cañones horrísonos truenen
y los ecos sonoros resuenen
con las voces de ¡Unión! ¡Libertad!
VI
Antes, Patria, que inermes tus hijos
bajo el yugo su cuello dobleguen,
tus campiñas con sangre se rieguen,
sobre sangre se estampe su pie.
Y tus templos, palacios y torres
se derrumben con hórrido estruendo,
y sus ruinas existan diciendo:
de mil héroes la Patria aquí fue.
X
¡Patria! ¡Patria! tus hijos te juran
exhalar en tus aras su aliento,
si el clarín con su bélico acento
los convoca a lidiar con valor.
¡Para ti las guirnaldas de oliva!
¡un recuerdo para ellos de gloria!
¡un laurel para ti de victoria!
¡un sepulcro para ellos de honor!
Oficialmente en 1943 el texto del himno nacional fue completamente publicado con sus diez estrofas y estribillo, pero algunas se recortaron porque hacían referencia a Santa Anna, por eso se recortó a solo cuatro estrofas que son las estrofas I, V, VI y X, de la versión original y el estribillo. La modificación de la letra fue ordenada primero por el Presidente Manuel Ávila Camacho pero solo se oficializó en 1984 por el Presidente Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado a las cuatro estrofas con el fin de hacerlo más fácil de interpretar.
Música
En el Capítulo Especial, Artículo 58 de la Ley se presenta una copia de la partitura de la música del Himno, consistente básicamente en dos partes: una para el estribillo y otra para las estrofas.
Primera página de la partitura y letra.
Segunda página de la partitura y letra.

Interpretación
La forma de interpretar el himno es como sigue:
Estribillo, Estrofa I, Estribillo, Estrofa II, Estribillo, Estrofa III, Estribillo, Estrofa IV, Estribillo.

Uso
En el artículo 42 de la Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales, se menciona que:
El Himno Nacional sólo se ejecutará, total o parcialmente, en actos solemnes de carácter oficial, cívico, cultural, escolar o deportivo, …
En el caso de las versiones parciales indica que en planteles escolares y eventos deportivos, tales como los Juegos Olímpicos, las únicas partes del himno que pueden interpretarse o reproducirse son estribillo y estrofa I. Otras salvedades son: para otros casos como los cierres y aperturas de trasmisiones de estaciones de radio o televisión, pueden alterar dentro de las cuatro estrofas oficiales y previa autorización de la Secretaría de Gobernación la versión que transmiten, aunque nunca pueden acortar las versiones completas que se producen durante ceremonias oficiales.
En ceremonias oficiales en territorio mexicano de instituciones públicas y privadas donde deba tocarse el Himno Nacional y otro extranjero, se ejecutará en primer lugar el mexicano; pero si existe un protocolo, como en los Juegos Olímpicos, se interpretará de acuerdo al orden que marque el protocolo correspondiente de ese acto.
Por otro lado su uso como distintivo de honor se ejecuta acompañado de otra música; por ejemplo; para hacer honores al Presidente de la República, las bandas militares presentes tocarán la «Marcha de Honor»; el caso de honores a la bandera, las bandas de música ejecutarán el himno y a la vez las bandas militares tocarán la marcha llamada «Bandera» y establece un límite a sus interpretaciones en ese caso, dos veces, para hacer honores a la Bandera y rendir honores al Presidente de la República. Aunque se indica la salvedad de que cuando sea interpretado por un coro las bandas militares deberán permanecer en silencio para apagar al coro.
En cualquier caso los presentes deberán demostrar el respecto asumiendo la posición de firme y en caso de que existan varones deben tener la cabeza descubierta, salvedad que se hace con militares que disponen de un ceremonial propio.
Uso en el extranjero
En el extranjero, las embajadas, consulados y legaciones oficiales de la Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores son las encargadas de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley y el respeto al himno nacional, evitando su uso comercial y autorizando su interpretación previa consulta con la Secretaría de Gobernación en situaciones que no sean actos cívicos, además de promover su interpretación en actos públicos solemnes realizados por mexicanos. Además tiene la obligación de solicitar ante el gobierno que está acreditado que prohíba su uso, sobre todo si es de carácter comercial.
En otros idiomas
En México hay personas que conservan y hablan exclusivamente lenguas indígenas o propias de su cultura de origen, desde el 8 de diciembre de 2005, el artículo 39 de la ley permite la traducción de la letra a las lenguas nativas. La traducción debe ser sancionada por el Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas y autorizada por la Secretaría de Gobernación.
Hasta 2014, el himno nacional ha sido traducido a las siguientes lenguas indígenas: chinanteco, otomí, mixteco, maya, náhuatl y huasteco. Otros grupos nativos han traducido el himno a sus respectivas lenguas, pero no ha sido sancionado por el gobierno.
Fuera de las lenguas nativas, ha sido traducido al bajo alemán (Plautdietsch). Niños y jóvenes menonitas de México entonan el himno nacional mexicano traducido al alemán dentro de sus colegios cada lunes. En 2008 resultó ganador a nivel estatal un colegio menonita llamado La Esperanza del municipio chihuahuense de Cuauhtémoc, quienes entonaron el himno nacional mexicano en español y una estrofa en su idioma materno.
Enseñanza y difusión
Desde 2005 es una obligación la enseñanza del Himno Nacional en todos los planteles de educación prescolar, primaria y secundaria en el país. Para lograr eso, desde ese año se organiza un Concurso Nacional de Interpretación del Himno por Coros Infantiles.
Vigilancia
En México la Secretaría de Gobernación es la encargada de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley, aunque se puede ayudar de las demás oficinas del gobierno federal. Como el caso de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores para otras naciones o la Secretaría de Educación Pública para el caso de la difusión y enseñanza.
Importancia cultural
Aficionados mexicanos interpretando el himno nacional antes de un partido de fútbol.
Tras la escritura del himno, México seguía enfrentándose a los efectos de una derrota en una guerra con Estados Unidos. El país se sentía desmoralizado y también dividido, debido a la pérdida de aproximadamente la mitad de su territorio, el cual le pertenecía ya a Estados Unidos. De acuerdo con el historiador Javier Garciadiego, quien habló en una ceremonia conmemorativa del 150.º aniversario de la aprobación del himno en 2004, el himno hace caso omiso a las divisiones y conflictos y anima la unidad nacional. En esa misma fecha, la Ciudad de México y otras partes del país detuvieron lo que hacían e interpretaron un canto del himno a nivel nacional. Individuos de otras naciones participaron también, mayoritariamente en las oficinas diplomáticas o en lugares donde se encontraban una alta concentración de expatriados de México. El himno también ha sido descrito como uno de los símbolos de la «identidad mexicana».
Antes de 1820
Entre los pueblos prehispánicos no se tiene noticia de que existiera al menos algo parecido a un himno que se identificara unívocamente a algunos de los altépetl, pero al llegar las tradiciones europeas tras la llamada Conquista Española, florecieron los llamados himnos religiosos en cuyas letras y música alababan la vida de algún Santo o la deidad de la Iglesia Católica, así como los himnos cívicos que trataban de alabar la llegada de virreyes, de obispos, clérigos, la entronización de reyes españoles y más comúnmente la vida de algún personaje o grupo novohispano, de entre los autores más destacados de ese tipo de himnos tenemos a Manuel de Sumaya, José de Torres y José Aldana, cuya obra religiosa fue profusamente elogiadas en su tiempo y aún hoy, destacan de toda su obra los himnos dedicados a la Virgen de Guadalupe. La primera vez que existió en México algo muy parecido a un Himno Nacional fue la llamada Marcha Real o Marcha Granadera que desde 1761 se empezó a usar en España y sus colonias durante las ceremonias cívicas, autoría de Manuel de Espinosa de los Monteros, fue una obra de cierto agrado que influyo en los años posteriores en el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano que se formó durante la Guerra de Independencia
Siglo xix
Al consumarse la independencia de México en 1821, el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano solo impulsó la creación de un escudo y bandera nacional como símbolo del nuevo estado. Al parecer la idea de un Himno Nacional no era una necesidad por eso durante la entronización de Agustín de Iturbide se cantó el himno religioso Veni Creator en forma especial. Posteriormente el protocolo de toma del cargo para el primer presidente y vicepresidente de México no incluyó ningún himno o canción usada como un himno.
A pesar de eso, durante ese primer medio siglo, nunca faltaron propuestas informales de himnos que trataron de tomar el lugar. Por ejemplo, durante la etapa final de la Guerra de Independencia se realizó un sitio a la ciudad de Querétaro por parte de tropas Trigarantes, entre esas tropas se encontraba un músico llamado José Torrescano quien compuso un himno muy anti español, cuya frase más cuestionada era:
Somos independientes,/viva la Libertad,/viva América libre/y viva la igualdad.
Por eso no fue muy promovido el himno, ya que la idea del Ejército Trigarante era lograr la unidad de todos los grupos sociales de la Nueva España.
Ya en lo que se considera el México independiente, en 1822, otro músico de nombre José María Garmendía realizó otro himno que no gustó por estar muy centrado en la figura de Agustín de Iturbide. Por ejemplo, sus primeras palabras eran:
A las armas, valientes indianos;/a las armas corred con valor;/el partido seguid de Iturbide;/seamos libres y no haya opresión.
Por eso al cambiar de régimen monárquico a republicano este fue totalmente olvidado.
Luego, durante las república tanto federalista como centralista, cuando se querían hacer honores al presidente o vicepresidente se interpretaba alguna pieza de su agrado. Por ejemplo Antonio López de Santa Anna gustaba de la obertura Semiramis de Gioachino Rossini, mientras José Joaquín de Herrera prefería Poeta y campesino de Franz von Suppé.
El 13 de julio de 1844 otro músico de nombre musicalizó un poema anónimo que honraba a Antonio López de Santa Anna quien estaba en su 8º periodo de gobierno durante la república centralista, este no gustó al público y terminó olvidado.
En 1849 luego de la desastrosa Guerra Mexicana-Estadounidense de 1846 a 1848 y durante la presidencia federal de José Joaquín de Herrera se formó una llamada Junta Patriótica de la Ciudad de México que, a través de la Academia de San Juan de Letrán, organizó un concurso para buscar una letra que junto a la música del pianista austriaco Henri Herz, pudiera formar un himno nacional. Ese primer concurso fue la propuesta más seria hasta el momento, incluía entre sus jueces a personajes muy destacados de la época, como Andrés Quintana Roo, Manuel Lacunza, José Joaquín Pesado, Manuel Carpio y Alejandro Arango y Escandón. El concurso fue ganado por el estadounidense Andrés David Bradburn, lo cual junto con el contenido de la obra hizo que fuera un verdadero fracaso que terminó por olvidarse.
Poco después, en 1850, la misma Academia de San Juan de Letrán realizó su propio concurso para musicalizar un poema del cubano Juan Miguel Lozada, la música seleccionada fue obra de Nicolás-Charles Bochsa, pero al ser un poema muy centrado en la figura del presidente José Joaquín de Herrera no trascendió.
Al parecer durante ese año se dio una especie de competencia informal ya que el músico italiano Antonio Barilli propuso no solo un himno, propuso dos, los cuales de ninguna manera fueron del agrado del pueblo mexicano. Poco después, en 1851, otro músico de origen checo Max Maretzek presentó su propuesta y no fructificó, y así se fueron acumulando en tan solo tres años varios intentos. En abril de 1853, el italiano Inocencio Pellegrini, presentó su “Canto Nacional” sin mucho éxito, si es que tuvo alguno. En diciembre de 1853, otro músico de apellido Infante creó una composición patriótica dedicada a Antonio López de Santa Anna la cual solo se tocó una noche.
Otras personalidades que presentaron propuestas formales e informales fueron, Fernando Calderón y Beltrán, José María Garmendia, Francisco Manuel Sánchez de Tagle, Mariano Elízaga y José María Heredia
Competencia oficial
No se sabe si debido a esa efervescencia o solo por el gusto del entonces presidente y dictador Antonio López de Santa Anna el 12 de noviembre de 1853 por medio del Diario Oficial del gobierno de la República Mexicana se dio a conocer un doble concurso, cuyo fin y orden seria seleccionar un poema patriótico y su musicalización posterior para formar un Himno a la Patria. 
En 1854 se celebraría el 25 Aniversario de "La Victoria de Tampico de 1829" cuando Antonio López de Santa Anna venció al Ejército Español en su intento de reconquista. Buscó Santa Anna festejar por todo lo alto su gran victoria militar donde alcanzó el rango de General de División. El concurso se convocó con la anticipación debida para que el 11 de septiembre del siguiente año se tuviera el Himno Nacional arreglado.
Para la letra se solicitaba enviar la propuesta en sobre cerrado con un seudónimo al Ministerio de Fomento, Colonización, Industria y Comercio en menos de veinte días, tras lo cual se tardarían diez días para definir al ganador, luego de darse a conocer al ganador, la musicalización tendría otro mes para recibir propuestas, tras lo cual se tardaría un mes más para dar a conocer al ganador de la música. En la misma convocatoria se definía que los derechos de explotación de las propuestas pasarían a manos del gobierno central y solo se entregaría una contraprestación a los ganadores. Esta convocatoria fue firmada por el entonces oficial mayor del ministerio Miguel Lerdo de Tejada, el jurado para la letra estuvo formado por José Bernardo Couto, Manuel Carpio y José Joaquín Pesado, mientras el jurado para la música se integró por José Antonio Gómez, Agustín Balderas y Tomás León.
El resultado para la letra se publicó el 4 de febrero de 1854 en el diario oficial junto a la letra, siendo ganador el potosino Francisco González Bocanegra, quien luego se supiera realizó la letra encerrado en una habitación por la que era entonces su prometida, Guadalupe González del Pino, ya que él no quería participar en el concurso. González fue anunciado el ganador en el Diario Oficial del gobierno de la República Mexicana del 3 de febrero de 1854.
Si bien el himno de González Bocanegra es un himno de corte bélico, no lo es de ataque, agresión ó expansionismo sino todo lo contrario, es un himno de defensa de la patria y del territorio nacional. Seguramente inspirado en el evento militar que se recordaba y festejaba ese año de 1854 al cumplirse 25 años de la Invasión Española de Reconquista, el poeta narra en sus estrofas la situación y disposición de los mexicanos y la nación ante una invasión extranjera, no así para una guerra intestina y fratricida. Santa Anna, el gran "Vencedor de Tampico" sería recordado en ese himno santanista que incluso le fue obsequiado por González Bocanegra en la dedicatoria la misma noche de su estreno en el Gran Teatro de Santa Anna. El himno reseña una gran victoria militar contra un "extraño enemigo" es decir una nación extranjera. La única gran victoria con esas características que se celebraba en México en esa época era la obtenida en Tampico en 1829. 
Como decía la convocatoria, tras darse a conocer al ganador de la letra se abrió el concurso de la música, se realizó como se decía en un mes, siendo ganadora la obra del músico italiano Giovanni Bottesini, pero simplemente no gusto, además fue acusado de musicalizar y dar a conocer por fuera del concurso su propuesta, lo cual era contrario a los términos del concurso. Debido a eso, el concurso se prolongó hasta los ciento ochenta días, mientras el 18 de mayo de 1854 estreno formalmente su propuesta en el Teatro Santa Anna con las voces de la soprano Enriqueta Sontag y el tenor Gaspar Pozzolini, pero aun así no fue del agrado del público en general.
Tras esa prolongación a ciento ochenta días, fue la propuesta del músico español Jaime Nunó Roca la que ganó. Por entonces Nunó era director de las bandas militares del ejército nacional, ese puesto lo había logrado por invitación de Antonio López de Santa Anna quien lo había conocido en uno de sus varios exilios en Cuba. Su obra con el seudónimo Dios y Libertad, fue declarada ganadora el 12 de agosto de 1854 por medio del Diario Oficial del gobierno de la República Mexicana. El himno fue aceptado el día de la independencia del mismo año. La interpretación inaugural fue dirigida por Giovanni Bottesini, cantado por Claudia Florenti y Lorenzo Salvi, en el Teatro Santa Anna.
Poco más de un mes después, la noche del 15 de septiembre de 1854, fue interpretado públicamente por primera vez el himno, en el entonces famoso Teatro Santa Anna, que por entonces cerraba al poniente la calle que hoy se llama 5 de Mayo en el hoy llamado Centro Histórico de la ciudad de México que en aquella época era lo único que se llamaba ciudad de México. Luego de algunas palabras del poeta Francisco González Bocanegra se interpretó el himno, dirigido por Giovanni Bottesini y las voces de Claudina Florentini, Lorenzo Salvi y coros del teatro a cargo de René Masón y Pedro Carvajal, esa primera vez no fue el estreno oficial ya que solo hasta el día siguiente fue cuando Antonio López de Santa Anna en su carácter de presidente asistió a su interpretación, por parte de Balbina Steffenone y Lorenzo Salvi. Al contrario de todos los intentos anteriores su éxito fue casi inmediato y su partitura se vendió en las calles.
Su rechazo y aceptación
Pero no duro mucho su fortuna, el 9 de agosto de 1855 Antonio López de Santa Anna deja la presidencia por última vez y abandona México, Jaime Nunó le sigue a la Habana y luego se pierde en los EE.UU.; A la vez Francisco González Bocanegra se esconde en casa de un tío para evitar represalias y no vuelve ponerse a descubierto del público, muere de tifo el 11 de abril de 1861 a sus 37 años. La causa de ese repentino cambio es por la llamada Revolución de Ayutla que desde el 1 de marzo de 1854 venia impulsando un cambio de gobierno, federalista y liberal.
Por la Revolución de Ayutla los grupos liberales y federalistas se hacen del poder e inicia la llamada Época de la Reforma, que traería personajes como Benito Juárez, Melchor Ocampo, Ignacio Ramírez, Miguel Lerdo de Tejada, Guillermo Prieto, Juan N. Álvarez e Ignacio Comonfort, como eran contrarios a Santa Anna hicieron lo posible para que se olvidara el himno santanista, si bien no lo prohibieron de ninguna manera alentaron su interpretación pero poco a poco el himno fue ganando adeptos. Por ejemplo, al final de la Guerra de Reforma cuando las tropas federales retomaban la ciudad de México el Gral. Liberal Florencio María del Castillo relata que
La comitiva se detuvo frente al primer arco para escuchar el himno, cuya letra sentimos no haber conseguido. Terminado el himno, fue entonada la Marsellesa, esa marcha que conmueve los corazones de todos los pueblos y la multitud repitió el estribillo.
De lo anterior se puede ampliar que hasta la llamada Segunda Intervención Francesa el himno más popular en México entre los liberales y muchos otros grupos era La Marsellesa, y que aun durante la guerra en el Segundo Imperio Mexicano era el himno preferido por Benito Juárez para ser tocado en su presencia como Presidente de México. Otro himno muy popular, aunque no fue escrito como tal, fue obra de Guillermo Prieto quien la había escrito como poema satírico en 1853, apareció en su libro de 1854 “Viajes de Orden Suprema”, ese poema musicalizado había sido presentado al concurso santanista por Guillermo Prieto a través de un tercero y titulada “La Marcha de los Cangrejos”, obviamente no ganó, pero para 1864 al inicio del Segundo Imperio Mexicano ya era una de las canciones más populares en México, al punto de que el propio Emperador Maximiliano solicitó que se tocara en su presencia durante una visita a la ciudad de Guanajuato en 1864, como una manera de congraciarse con los liberales, pero el efecto fue un severo susto e indignación de los grupos conservadores y monárquicos que lo apoyaron para llegar al trono. De ese himno informal Melchor Ocampo cuenta que
Los cangrejos, convertidos en himno popular, formulaban el regocijo y el orden y la concordia embellecían un día que lo sobreponen en grandeza a la recepción del Ejército Trigarante.(Sic)
Otra obra que llegó a ser muy popular y usada como himno fue “Adiós Mamá Carlota” que solo por su letra no terminó por oficializarse. En todo caso al final de la guerra y con la República Restaurada, el himno santanista volvió a tener presencia, si no es que la tuvo durante toda la guerra, aunque con varias modificaciones, por ejemplo en 1864 el presidente Benito Juárez discutió con varios sobre ciertas modificaciones a la letra, le sugerían suprimir la referencia al “Guerrero inmortal de Zempoala”, a lo que contesto:
Al Himno Nacional no se le quita ni una sola nota, ni una sola palabra.
Otro cambio que sí perduró fue en la séptima estrofa, cambiando, “Si a la lid contra Estado enemigo” por “Si a la lid contra hueste enemiga”, además de muchas otras que no perduraron.
Tras esa época llegó la presidencia de Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada hermano de quien siendo oficial mayor firmó la convocatoria al concurso de 1853, al parecer desde ese momento se impulsó el uso del himno santanista aunque con modificaciones. Tras la caída de su gobierno por el Plan de Tuxtepec, el nuevo presidente Porfirio Díaz empezó a usar el himno santanista de común para las ceremonias oficiales.
Siglo xx
En 1901 es redescubierto, por decirlo de alguna manera, el compositor Jaime Nunó. Un grupo de mexicanos que estaban de viaje por Estados Unidos lo encuentra en la ciudad de Buffalo, Nueva York, lo dan a conocer al presidente y este lo invita a visitar México, acepta y durante su visita por primera vez dirige orquesta y coros para interpretar el Himno Mexicano, pero su visita no resulta cálida y regresa a Nueva York. Para entonces era ciudadano estadounidense. En 1904 vuelve a ser invitado con motivo de los cincuenta años del Himno, con mucho más éxito que la visita anterior, esa fue la última vez que, vivo, tocó suelo mexicano, ya que muere el 18 de julio de 1908 en Bay City, Nueva Jersey. Durante su primera visita el 11 de febrero de 1901 tras una sesión solemne se anunció que el Congreso de la Unión concedía a Jaime Nunó y González Bocanegra la cantidad de dos mil pesos de entonces como contraprestación y premio por el concurso de 1853. Por parte de González Bocanegra, el dinero fue recibido por Mercedes Serralde de González Bocanegra como heredera del poeta, además a Nunó se le dieron los 388 pesos que puso de su bolsillo para hacer la primera tirada de la partitura en 1854, lo cual él ratificó en una entrevista al diario El Imparcial del 9 de julio de 1901.
Durante las celebraciones del Centenario de la Independencia se vuelve normal el uso del himno santanista y se le empieza a llamar corrientemente como “Himno Nacional Méxicano”. Durante la Revolución Mexicana ya tiene el sello de aprobación popular y oficial, pero sin una reglamentación clara, se interpreta con las estrofas a gusto del intérprete, aunque algunas ya se destacan entre las diez, cuatro de ellas en concreto. Para la llamada Guerra Cristera incluso se usa por parte del gobierno anticlerical la segunda estrofa que dice:
“…/de la paz el arcángel divino/'que en el cielo tu eterno destino/por el dedo de Dios se escribió/...
La primera vez que se grabó el Himno en un medio sonoro fue el 28 de julio de 1922 por la cantante duranguense Fanny Anitúa. Su versión, al decir de muchos, fue deficiente y modificada, lo que causó gran polémica al grado de requerir una revisión oficial, por parte del Consejo Cultural del Distrito Federal. La revisión fue llevada a cabo por José López Portillo y Rojas, Manuel Barajas y Julián Carrillo. Durante esta revisión se conoció la pérdida de los textos originales, entonces el grupo recurrió a la familia de González Bocanegra, quienes entregaron originales del estribillo y las estrofas, también se consiguió una primera edición del Himno bajo el sello de la Casa Murguía en 1854. Por otra parte, una de las familias pudientes de la época, identificada como Pérez Salas, obsequió una instrumentación del Himno que el mismo Jaime Nunó envió a la plana mayor del Ejército Nacional y a la Dirección General de Artillería, uno de los que pagó con 388 pesos.
Esa revisión demostró los varios cambios que había sufrido el Himno, así como la dificultad de interpretarlo completo, por eso se empezó a limitar el número de estrofas, pero sin seguir una formalidad. Por eso el 4 de mayo de 1943, el entonces Presidente de México, Manuel Ávila Camacho, durante la participación de México en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, promulgó un Decreto que oficializaba el Himno y lo limitaba a las estrofas I, V, VI y X, más el estribillo. Por ese decreto se prohibió alterar, corregir o modificar la letra o la música. Ese decreto se formalizó aún más y conjugó con los otros símbolos patrios el 23 de diciembre de 1967 por la Ley sobre las características y el uso del Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales, ley que fue suprimida en 1984 por la Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales, la cual es el ordenamiento que la rige hasta hoy.
Controversias
Derechos de autor
En 1959 la Sociedad Repertorio Wagner, S. A., publicó una partitura para que se pudiera interpretar el Himno Nacional Mexicano por parte de las bandas civiles de música, el decreto de 1943 no tenía una partitura anexa y debía conseguirse aparte, además de que no era fácil duplicar el decreto, esa publicación levantó varios gritos de histeria y terror entre el pueblo mexicano, ya que varios periódicos difundieron la supuesta noticia de que Wagner era propietaria o se hacía pasar por propietaria del himno nacional. Debido a eso, por ejemplo, se dijo que cada lunes los estudiantes debían dar un peso a su escuela para poder interpretar el himno. Lo que a todas luces es falso.
De esta manera durante toda su vida el himno ha estado, por decirlo ligeramente, lleno de bromas de mal gusto, incluso en la era del internet, como ejemplo de ello está el rumor de que la Casa Wagner y Levien registró el Himno Nacional Mexicano y que por eso cobraba los derechos de ejecución, declarándose propietaria de la obra a nivel internacional, situación similar pasa en los EE.UU. con la casa Ralph S. Perr y Compañía.
Pero por más desmentido oficial que hace el gobierno mexicano, aún sigue el mito. En septiembre de 1959 luego de poner una multa a la Casa Wagner, se realizó una investigación para dilucidar si el rumor de que la familia de Jaime Nunó había vendido los derechos del autor a una casa musical en los EE.UU. de la investigación se determinó que no existió tal venta de sus derechos de explotación y menos sus derechos de autor, aunque luego se encontró que el mismo Jaime Nunó había vendido en la década de 1850 sus derechos de explotación efectivamente a una casa de música estadounidense pero solo de un arreglo a la música del himno, un arreglo para tocar el himno al piano, ese arreglo además estaba en otro ritmo y tenor por lo que era muy diferente a la versión original. Además, para 1960, ya habían pasado los cien años que protegía la legislación estadounidense los derechos de explotación y por la misma legislación al ser una obra anterior a 1909 no le aplicaba la ley vigente en 1953, antes de 1909 no existía ley en EE.UU. que protegiera eso, en último caso no transcendía su ley fuera de sus fronteras.
Otra versión de la venta de los derechos de Jaime Nunó es como sigue, el propio Nunó y dos estadounidenses, Harry Henneman y Phil Hill registraron la música de Nuñó con la empresa BMI, Edward B. Marks Music Company fue entonces la editora del himno en los EE.UU. en 1910 y 1911. Por lo que luego de encontrarse con las publicaciones de esa casa editorial varios mexicanos empezaron a propagar el rumor sobre que esa casa comercial era la dueña de los derechos de autor. No obstante, la ley de los derechos de autor en Estados Unidos declara que el himno mexicano está en el dominio público dentro de los Estados Unidos, dado que tanto la letra como la música fueron estrenadas antes de 1909. Además, bajo la ley de derechos de autor en México, el artículo 155 expone que el gobierno tiene los derechos morales, pero no el derecho de autor, del himno; además de que también en México está en dominio público ya que se cumplieron los cien años establecidos para su liberación desde el 2008.
Himno bélico
Otra polémica muy habitual se basa en que la letra del himno es muy bélica, por ejemplo se dice que el estribillo llama a la guerra “Mexicanos al grito de guerra”, por lo que varias veces se ha propuesto modificar o cambiar de plano el himno, incluso en tiempos recientes el poeta Javier Sicilia en una entrevista sobre la Caravana con Justicia y Dignidad a la pregunta de
También lo preguntaba por el lábaro patrio, porque he visto que te molesta el belicismo del Himno Nacional de México… Respondió Sicilia.
Cuando han intentado cantar el Himno en el templete de las caravanas yo digo: no, habría que cambiarlo, si lo escuchamos –es el problema de no atender a las palabras-, el Himno justifica la guerra, necesitamos cambiar la letra, esa letra no nos representa, fue de un momento histórico y no es el que vivimos, estamos en la búsqueda de la paz, del amor, del reconocimiento de lo humano, por encima de las fronteras y naciones.(Sic)
Esa polémica básicamente se ve en personajes de la izquierda mexicana, como lo es Sicilia.
Es un himno de la derecha
En forma paralela sobre el tema belicista del himno, esta la polémica sobre su origen santanista, ya que Antonio López de Santa Anna es uno, si no, el más odiado personaje de la historia mexicana, sobre todo se recuerda su participación en la Guerra Mexicana-Estadounidense y en la Guerra Texana, los principales defensores de esta polémica están en la llamada Izquierda, mientras los llamados políticos de Derecha normalmente defienden el himno como una obra propia de su tiempo que ha ganado su lugar en la historia y estima del pueblo. Como refuerzo del rechazo al himno se marca su estilo musical conocido como Quinta Real por su parecido con la Marcha Real, una marcha militar que desde 1791 se usa como himno de España.
Cine
En 1943, cuando se oficializó el himno, se estrenó la película Mexicanos al grito de guerra, dirigida por Álvaro Gálvez y Fuentes e Ismael Rodríguez y protagonizada por Pedro Infante y Lina Montes, cuya trama básica es la supuesta historia del Himno Nacional hasta la Batalla del 5 de mayo en Puebla. En la parte final se muestra a los soldados mexicanos cantando el himno para darse valor, pero ningún documento histórico ha podido respaldar esa escena.
El segundo
Durante décadas se ha dicho, e incluso medios de comunicación han informado, que el Himno Nacional Mexicano es considerado el segundo más bello del mundo, detrás de La Marsellesa pero hasta el día de hoy, no se ha llevado a cabo ningún tipo de concurso o competición arbitrada que avale ese dicho. Incluso es común oír este mito aplicado a otros Himnos Nacionales, como por ejemplo el ecuatoriano, colombiano, peruano, inglés, estadounidense, etc.

(Estribillo)
Mexicanos, al grito de guerra
El acero aprestad y el bridón;
Y retiemble en sus centros la tierra
Al sonoro rugir del cañón.
I
Ciña ¡Oh Patria! tus sienes de oliva
de la paz el arcángel divino,
que en el cielo tu eterno destino
por el dedo de Dios se escribió.
Mas si osare un extraño enemigo
profanar con su planta tu suelo,
piensa ¡Oh Patria querida! que el cielo
un soldado en cada hijo te dio.
II
En sangrientos combates los viste
por tu amor palpitando sus senos,
arrostrar la metralla serenos,
y la muerte o la gloria buscar.
Si el recuerdo de antiguas hazañas
de tus hijos inflama la mente,
los recuerdos del triunfo tu frente,
volverán inmortales a ornar.
III
Como al golpe del rayo la encina,
se derrumba hasta el hondo torrente,
la discordia vencida, impotente,
a los pies del arcángel cayó.
Ya no más, de tus hijos la sangre,
se derrame en contienda de hermanos;
sólo encuentre el acero en sus manos
quien tu nombre sagrado insultó.
IV
Del guerrero inmortal de Zempoala
te defiende la espada terrible,
y sostiene su brazo invencible,
tu sagrado pendón tricolor.
Él será del feliz mexicano
en la paz y en la guerra el caudillo.
porque él supo sus armas de brillo
circundar en los campos de honor.
V
¡Guerra, guerra sin tregua al que intente
de la patria manchar los blasones!
¡guerra, guerra! los patrios pendones
en las olas de sangre empapad.
¡Guerra, guerra! en el monte, en el valle,
los cañones horrísonos truenen
y los ecos sonoros resuenen
con las voces de ¡Unión! ¡Libertad!.
VI
Antes, Patria, que inermes tus hijos
bajo el yugo su cuello dobleguen,
tus campiñas con sangre se rieguen,
sobre sangre se estampe su pie.
Y tus templos, palacios y torres
se derrumben con hórrido estruendo,
y sus ruinas existan diciendo:
de mil héroes la patria aquí fue.
VII
Si a la lid contra hueste enemiga,
nos convoca la trompa guerrera,
de Iturbide la sacra bandera,
mexicanos, valientes seguid.
Y a los fieles bridones les sirvan
las vencidas enseñas de alfombra;
los laureles del triunfo den sombra
a la frente del Bravo Adalid.
VIII
Vuelva altivo a los patrios hogares,
el guerrero a cantar su victoria,
ostentando las palmas de gloria
que supiera en la lid conquistar.
Tornaránse sus lauros sangrientos
en guirnaldas de mirtos y rosas,
que el amor de las hijas y esposas,
también sabe a los bravos premiar.
IX
Y el que al golpe de ardiente metralla,
de la Patria en las aras sucumba,
obtendrá en recompensa una tumba
donde brille, de gloria, la luz.
Y, de Iguala, la enseña querida
a su espada sangrienta enlazada,
de laurel inmortal coronada,
formará de su fosa una cruz.
X
¡Patria! ¡Patria! tus hijos te juran
exhalar en tus aras su aliento,
si el clarín con su bélico acento
los convoca a lidiar con valor.
¡Para ti las guirnaldas de oliva!
¡un recuerdo para ellos de gloria!
¡un laurel para ti de victoria!
¡un sepulcro para ellos de honor!.

I was a bad reputation
With an attitude to match
Hellbent on goin' nowhere
And gettin' there lightnin' fast
Twenty-one and lookin' thirty
But actin' half my age
Bound to hit a wall
Before I ever hit the brakes

Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought somethin' like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dyin' man
When a Friday meets a Sunday
You can't help but see the light
I never believed in angels
'Til one believed in me that night
Turned my off-track into a straight line
Before I turned into a headline

Like, Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought somethin' like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dyin' man

Woah-oh
Turned a one-way man one-eighty
Settled down a given-upper
Yeah, you changed a "You can't change me"
So, the world won't see another

Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought somethin' like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dyin' man

Yeah, I'm always down for two beers
That ain't nothin' new here
It's usually what I do here, but not tonight
Yeah, we had a bad one
Way worse than the last one
Ain't no comin' back from this goodbye

Looks like I did it again, me and my stupid mouth
I dug myself into a hole in a wall and I gotta drink my way out
Bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice, yeah
I need a corner with the lights turned down
I can't take a good time cold beer crowd
It's just me, Jack and Jim
Won't you play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey friends?
Me and my whiskey friends

And we just need a slow song, tryna let her go song
Throw a little Jones on
Leave us alone 'til she's long gone
Got a lot of over-her work left to do that we need to get into

Bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice, yeah
I need a corner with the lights turned down

Tell 'em to shoot
I'm out the loop, I'm out of range
Oh, I stay out the way

Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin'
But these bitches in my business got me outchea choosin' violence
If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent
In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet
Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it like nobody know shit

I need you to get the fuck out my space (Yeah)
Replacement's on the way, please don't play
That pussy's feelin' like a great escape (Oh, oh)
I need a new trick, old dogs don't change
I'm fuckin', I ain't makin' love no more (Pussy)
You got a new bitch, what the fuck you cryin' for?
I'm movin' selfish, callin' all my favorite hoes
You know how to reach me every time and it plays in your mind
With a rush that feels like we committed a crime
Know where you belong, I'm gon' save you a spot
But can't be outside 'cause the block is too hot
And I'm all on your mind
Wherever you are, don't call me (Let's go)

Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin' (Alright)
But these bitches in my business got me outchea choosin' violence (Yeah, yeah)
If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent (Okay)
In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet

Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest

We fuckin', we ain't makin' love no more
You talk that talk, but it don't match it with your stroke
Wherever you are
Whatever you need
Don't call me
Don't call me

Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin'
But these bitches in my business got me outchea choosin' violence (Alright)

Strange light revolves around you
You float across the room
Your touch is made of something
Heaven can't hold a candle to
You're made of something new
Let's not get complicated
Let's just enjoy the view
It's hard to be a human
So much to put an answer to
But that's just what we do
God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

I'm having revelations
You dance across the floor
Beyond infatuation
How I obsessively adore you
That's what I do

I believe, I believe
I could die in your kiss
No, it doesn't get, doesn't get
Better than this

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same
God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames

Y por todo el bulevar
Con mi compa Flaco arremangando
Unos huaraches, mi gorra de lado
Por la Zapata, el Gordo trae el mando
Tirando linea con Manny y el Caña
A la orden pa'l desorden conectado
Y mi RT en Acapulco
Y si hay pedo, los sepulto
Aquí no andamos haciendo bulto
Al chingazo yo resulto
Y una glockzona que va conmigo
Siempre lista para un susto
Y que sigan llegando las pacas
Su compa Chinito
Puro Apaseo el Alto

Y mi compa Mario que nunca me deja
Unas banquetearas a veces tomando
Y mi compa Power y también el Mau
Me hacen segunda, nunca me han dejado
Y mi compa Sapo, si hay pedo, él brinca
A la orden en una a tirar vergazos
Y acá la envidia al chile que no existe
Y pa' qué les cuento si no tiene chiste
Yo soy el Gordo, para que se ubiquen
Y en una moto yo les caigo en 15

Y esta se va hasta Acapulco

All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let ’em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thankin’, thankin' God you found me
That you found me

Every day, I go places in my head
Darker thoughts are harder now
They look like monsters under my bed
And every time, it's like a rocket through my chest
The TV make you think the whole world's about to end
I don't know where this night is goin' (Goin')
But I know that you and me got somethin' (Somethin’)
So many things that I’m afraid of (I'm afraid of)
But right now, I ain’t scared of nothin'
('Cause all I know it's, ’cause all I know it's, all I, all I)

'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35

That you found me
So don't you worry about tomorrow
Don't you worry, just pass the bottle
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me

Every night, I go places in my dreams
So many never-endin' alleyways
I don't know what it means
But this is it, I know the sun'll wake me up
Tell me I'd be dumb to not get what I want

There's a bottle on the King James coaster
Miller Lite full of cigarettes
Too drunk to be hungover
Last night still on my breath
There ain't no startin' over
And this over never ends
I've been tryna drown these demons
I'll be damned if they don't swim

What's keepin' me up all night is knowin' what's keepin' you up all night
Since I ain't the one holdin' on to you, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Fire and brimstone ain't got nothin' on seein' you with someone else
It's a whole 'nother level, girl, even the devil don't know this kinda hell
It ain't the one out of Revelation
Nah, it's way too cold for that
It's the heartbreak that won't stop
Everywhere you're not
And everything I can't get back

I thought by now I'd have it figured out
How not to make the easy thing so hard to do
I bet that I'd be further down this road
If I could read the signs that point me to the truth

I never planned on being nothin' but a cowboy
But somewhere I picked up this old guitar
Girl, all I can say is that I'm sorry
If I get kinda careless with your heart
All the headlights, all the midnights
Chasin' all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy and the gypsy
I guess all I'm sayin' is forgive me
If I don't know what I'm doin'

So far I've been good at burnin' bridges
Strike a match and ride right out of town

Or quit me or slow me down

Rollin' outta nowhere with the brakes off

Granddaddy drank Heavy, and daddy drank Light
I can turn any day to Saturday night, if I want to
And most the time I want to
I can still paint a picture of a hemlock view
My mountains had smoke, but the ones that were blue that we'd buy then
Were the ones I spent a little more time in
Between the hangovers and the handcuffs
It’s been a minute since I had one in my hand, 'cause

Everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I’m livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriеty
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I’m just sayin’ I'm doin’ thе best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand
When I was puttin' 'em down, they put me through hell
Put some scars on some trucks, myself as well
But if I never did put that can to my mouth
I wouldn't have nothin’ I could sing about

Yeah, everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I'm livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriety
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I'm just sayin' I'm doin' the best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?

Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid (Hopeless girl is seeking)
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid (Someone who will share this feeling)
다시 한번 못 들은 척 기회를 줄게 (I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb (A fool for love, a fool for love)Embed
